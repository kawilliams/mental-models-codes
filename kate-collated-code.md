- Idea origin
  - Seen before: F6, F9, J10, P11, F12, J13, P14, J16, P20, F21, P24, J25,
    P26, F27, P29, F30
  - Not seen before: P17, J19, P23, J31
  - Unclear: J28
  - Related to something personal: F6, F9, F12, J13, J16, F18, J19, P20, F21,
    F30
  - Altered from mental model for communication: F21

- Mental model:
  - Did not change: J7, P8, F9, P14, P17, F18, J19, F21, J22, P24, F27, J28,
    P29, F30
  - Revised during drawing, but mostly the same: F6, F15, P20, J25, J31
  - Mental model becomes more detailed in drawing process: J25, P26, J31
  - Changed: P23
  - Imagined physical objects: P8, F15
  - Drawing not good enough to match: F12, J19
  - Introduction fo task changes mental model: P14
  - Situating in real life: J7, P17

- Embellished while talking to facilitator: F6, F9

- Drawing constrained by drawing space: J7, F15, J16, P23, P26


- Interesting others
  - F6 states their diagram is like Win98 or XP, but no view exists like that.
    Note they are a CS major so this may have something to do with that
  - F9 uses color for aesthetic embellishment
  - P14 has a lot of data analysis literacy and uses that to speak
  - F15 found manila folder inside manila folder violate mental model
  - J16 suggests items are nouns, modified by adjectives --- suggesting a
    typology?
  - J16 suggests data can distract from communication/story
  - P17 noted power stations are un-even, a sort of smell test
  - J19 noted paper clips were not in the dataset (what's missing)
  - F21 has some interesting statements on communicating data
  - P23 seemed to have difficulty expressing their mental model and ended up
    only drawing a portion of the dataset. It seemed they had trouble with the
dimensionality. They noted there were 'so many categories.' They were familiar with bar, pie, and line charts however.
  - P26 talked about a range of representations for different audiences but
    drew the representation that best matched themself
  - F27 thought the dataset was not the file hierarchy itself, but what was in
    the files being described
  - J28 believed the junk drawer order was on purpose and divided things along
    that order
