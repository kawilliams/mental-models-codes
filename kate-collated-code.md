  - By personal preference: P7, P21
  - By guessed outer context: P9
  - By price: P16
  - By size: P19

- Items:
  - Show all: P18, P19, P21

- Adding information not there: P7, P9, P18 (Ids, schema), P21 (schema)

- Tried to assign task (purpose-seeking): P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P19

- Inferring source/big picture: P7, P10, P16, P17, P19, P20, P21

- Types as icons
  - Filesystem: P6, P9, P15
  - Power plant: P8

Abstraction:
  - Voiced abstraction from get-go: P14
  - Abstraction as drawing continues: P8, P9, P11

- Describe dataset rather than drawing: D8


- Idea origin
  - Seen before: P6, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P20, P21
  - Not seen before: P17, P19
  - Related to something personal: P6, P9, P12, P13, P16, P18, P19, P20, P21
  - Altered from mental model for communication: P21

- Mental model:
  - Did not change: P7, P8, P9, P14, P17, P18, P19, P21
  - Revised during drawing, but mostly the same: P6, P15, P20
  - Changed: 
  - Imagined physical objects: P8, P15
  - Drawing not good enough to match: P12, P19
  - Introduction fo task changes mental model: P14
  - Situating in real life: P7, P17

- Embellished while talking to facilitator: P6, P9

- Drawing constrained by drawing space: P7, P15, P16


- Interesting others
  - P6 states their diagram is like Win98 or XP, but no view exists like that.
    Note they are a CS major so this may have something to do with that
  - P9 uses color for aesthetic embellishment
  - P14 has a lot of data analysis literacy and uses that to speak
  - P15 found manila folder inside manila folder violate mental model
  - P16 suggests items are nouns, modified by adjectives --- suggesting a
    typology?
  - P16 suggests data can distract from communication/story
  - P17 noted power stations are un-even, a sort of smell test
  - P19 noted paper clips were not in the dataset (what's missing)
  - P21 has some interesting statements on communicating data
