- Describe dataset rather than drawing: P8, P27


- Idea origin
  - Seen before: P6, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P20, P21, P24, P25,
    P26, P27, P29

  - Altered from mental model for communication: P21

- Mental model:
  - Did not change: P7, P8, P9, P14, P17, P18, P19, P21, P22, P24, P27, P28,
    P29
  - Revised during drawing, but mostly the same: P6, P15, P20, P25
  - Mental model becomes more detailed in drawing process: P25, P26
  - Changed: P23
  - Imagined physical objects: P8, P15
  - Drawing not good enough to match: P12, P19
  - Introduction fo task changes mental model: P14
  - Situating in real life: P7, P17

- Embellished while talking to facilitator: P6, P9

- Drawing constrained by drawing space: P7, P15, P16, P23, P26


- Interesting others
  - P6 states their diagram is like Win98 or XP, but no view exists like that.
    Note they are a CS major so this may have something to do with that
  - P9 uses color for aesthetic embellishment
  - P14 has a lot of data analysis literacy and uses that to speak
  - P15 found manila folder inside manila folder violate mental model
  - P16 suggests items are nouns, modified by adjectives --- suggesting a
    typology?
  - P16 suggests data can distract from communication/story
  - P17 noted power stations are un-even, a sort of smell test
  - P19 noted paper clips were not in the dataset (what's missing)
  - P21 has some interesting statements on communicating data
  - P23 seemed to have difficulty expressing their mental model and ended up
    only drawing a portion of the dataset. It seemed they had trouble with the
dimensionality. They noted there were 'so many categories.' They were familiar with bar, pie, and line charts however.
  - P26 talked about a range of representations for different audiences but
    drew the representation that best matched themself
  - P27 thought the dataset was not the file hierarchy itself, but what was in
    the files being described
  - P28 believed the junk drawer order was on purpose and divided things along
    that order
