Codes
=====
## Participants often want to add additional information, data that isn’t there
  - Add data attributes to each item: For the file system, a participant wanted to add the file sizes
      - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render) 

  - Add data attributes to each item: For the power plants, participants want to reduce down to the number of people or to the number of individual units 
    - [Session 014](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dm3ak/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
  - Add data attributes to each item: Observation by KI - Participants want to add a 'richness' to the data in lots of dimensions. This isn't their data so they want to put it into the context of what they know.

## Purpose-seeking

In these codes, participants infer a bigger picture or task.

### Participants want to uncover the purpose: “Why is the file system organized like this?,” “what are the power stations doing?”
  - Make a story/context for the file system: 
    - [Session 006](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kj4nt/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

### Participants want to discover ultima: For power plant, which one produces the most energy?   
  - Supported by:
    - [Session 011](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kaemj/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

  - Not Supported:
    - [Session 008](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/47sng/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

### Participants suggest or assume other tasks

    - [Session 029](https://osf.io/bph2d/)
  - Math problem
    - [Session 031](https://osf.io/cy3s4/)

### Participants suggest source of data, such as all being part of a toolbox
  - [Session 007](https://osf.io/kxze2/) - stationary drawer
  - [Session 010](https://osf.io/kedv9/) - office supplies

  - [Session 022](https://osf.io/psv9g/) - office supplies
  - [Session 024](https://osf.io/742fb/) - comes from residentail neighborhood
  - [Session 028](https://osf.io/4u63n/) - office items, pre-sorted
  - [Session 030](https://osf.io/9jxy3/) - organization of some program

## The idea that data relates to computers is prevalent: 
  - [Session 010](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kgv76/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render) wrote a Python dictionary. 
  - Participants used file system icons that they cited as being from an operating system.
    - [Session 006](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kj4nt/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 015](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/y487f/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
  - Reliance on tables: 
    - Session 007: 
      Me: "Did it surprise you that we called it a data set?" 

      S: I was expecting something more structured, maybe like a table or something. I guess I was expecting a table. Because that’s the most common form of storing data, like a spreadsheet or table, something like that. I guess this a valid data set, it’s got objects and quantities for those objects.  
    - Session 014: 
      N: "For instance, there was apartments, there was houses, there was homes, there were warehouses so the first thing I thought in my mind was how to arrange those in a table in order to get an idea of how much power each house or apartment would generate or require."



## Physical objects can also be used to represent data
  - Their organization (e.g. orientation, appearance, affordances) is based on the real world

    - Appearance: based on / tied to memories
      - [Session 013](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dgzrs/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): the pencils, etc. 
      - [Session 008](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/47sng/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): the cooling towers 

    - Affordances: 
      - [Session 015](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/zn6qj/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): “physical” folder, issue of running out of space, words about putting things into the folder and it becoming out of shape: "Having a folder inside a folder, I guess. So that would - I guess since I’m imagining it physically, it would be cumbersome to have a folder inside a folder."

## Participants tend to draw things in order of reading.
  - Often, but not always, this order reflects itself on the page
    - Support: File System and Power Station tend to be drawn in order of reading
      - Session 26: intentionally gave the participant the power stations in non-alphabetical order. They drew a table, rows in alphabetical order, and then filled in the cells in read-order (not alphabetically).
    - Against: junk drawer examples. We see organization on the page that is not related to the read-order but instead related to the physical objects
      - 016-B-bonus.jpg: this user came up with ways to arrange the data based on attributes that they added

## People run into constraints with their existing sketch.

  - People run out of space when drawing.

    - [Session 007](https://osf.io/kxze2/): adds sharpies outside of pencil pouch because "I didn't make the pouch big enough."

    - [Session 015](https://osf.io/zn6qj/): drew outline of open folder first and then drew smaller rectangles inside for the files, but ran out of space: "it's hard to draw this. I should've brought a pencil."

    - [Session 016](https://osf.io/d4efp/): ran out of space drawing bars left to right, "I had to skip back here (left) to fill out the rest of the space."

    - [Session 022](https://osf.io/psv9g/): would have "made the basket a little bigger."

## People use text for clarity and understanding.
  - *Note: use of text was only noted if the participant noted that they used text.*
  - [Session 009](https://osf.io/es7w6/): calls the files ".java" so that "we can be more explicit."
  - [Session 016](https://osf.io/d4efp/): participant "modified some of the descriptions" to help "me process a bit better." Switched to "noun, adjective."
  - [Session 019](https://osf.io/z3j9f/): to communicate to another person, the participant said they would use lists
  - [Session 021](https://osf.io/v4nmf/): used file "abbreviation" based on "knowing what text files look like" and "makes sense to me." For the code files, didn't know what the code was, so "I just said 'two code'."
  - [Session 027](https://osf.io/q9cn5/): "feel that when I use icons, unless it’s mutually understood by both people, it might confuse; or even I might forget what the notation actually stood for... You can't go wrong with text, and it's not long either." 
  - [Session 030](https://osf.io/9jxy3/): used "common file extensions", but recognized they used a mix of "tokens" for the file types
  - [Session 029](https://osf.io/bph2d/): asterisk footnote for residents per apartment

## People add details for clarity and understanding.
  - *Note: use of detail was only noted if the participant noted that they added detail on purpose.*
  - [Session 012](https://osf.io/xbw3h/): added labels and arrows to suggest hypotheses about the nature of the files and their relations.
  - [Session 015](https://osf.io/zn6qj/): added shading for clarity.
  - [Session 019](https://osf.io/z3j9f/): suggests adding more detail to distinguish pens, pencils, and sharpies.
  - [Session 020](https://osf.io/5rsjc/):suggests adding weights to directed arrows, "it would be an improvement."
  - [Session 023](https://osf.io/t45ry/): added a scale. In a revised version they would "include power station letters somehow."
  - [Session 031](https://osf.io/cy3s4/): wishes they added detail to help clarify what items were
  - TODO: Do we add instances of all representations of objects/things that were more complicated than simple shapes?
    - E.g. [Session 024](https://osf.io/742fb/) used squares for houses and long rectangles with 3-4 "little squares inside them" for windows to represent apartments. Is this an example of adding detail for clarity? The participant mentioned this distinction and that the squares were added as windows to the apartments.

## No one drew a key (e.g. "(house symbol) = house"), but participants often explained symbols when they didn't match the physical appearance of the object
  - [Session 006](https://osf.io/pkqsm/): verbally explains the icons for the types of files.
  - [Session 024](https://osf.io/742fb/): verbally explained that small squares represent homes.


## People identify when the drawing alone wouldn't make sense to another person.
  - [Session 031](https://osf.io/cy3s4/): "between the pens and the pencils and the sharpies, you can’t really tell what they are. If I were to give it to somebody, they probably wouldn’t be able to tell -- to differentiate between those groups...I probably should have written 'envelopes' on them, or some type of -- you know, if somebody were to look at this, I don’t think they would know what I drew."

## Adding interaction, especially to the file system data set
  - Sessions 006, 012, 030
  - data abstraction + interaction
  - Session 021 had interactive state changes (interview notes, when asked how they would change their visualization for another person)



Alex 
====
## Aggregative marks and eliding details


Items of interest
=================
- See whose mental model changed (i.e. they say "yes, it changed by drawing" or if they used differing terms/visualizations/abstrations from the "gut reaction" question to the "did you mental model change by drawing" question)
- What are the different "obvious" groupings people used for the junk drawer?
- Count the number of people who add annotations when talking (connects to Future Work)
- People naturally try to find groups, the outlier sticks out (but the definition of "outlier" is loose)






Still Developing
================
- The variety of the data abstractions that we saw
  - for all 3 data sets
    - FS: hierarchies (not not necessarily), database tables
    - PS: node link 
    - JD: 

- Impose structure/hierarchy: for the junk drawer, some participants group items 
  - [Session 013](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dgzrs/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
  - [Session 007](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/hsy7q/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

- Impose structure/hierarchy: For the file system, a participant wanted to add names that reflected a folder hierarchy
  - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
