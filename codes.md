## Participants often want to add additional information, data that isn’t there

  - Impose structure/hierarchy: for the junk drawer, some participants group items 
    - [Session 013](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dgzrs/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 007](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/hsy7q/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

  - Impose structure/hierarchy: For the file system, a participant wanted to add names that reflected a folder hierarchy
    - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

  - Add data attributes to each item: For the file system, a participant wanted to add the file sizes
      - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render) 

  - Add data attributes to each item: For the power plants, participants want to reduce down to the number of people or to the number of individual units 
    - [Session 014](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dm3ak/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
  - Add data attributes to each item: Observation by KI - Participants want to add a 'richness' to the data in lots of dimensions. This isn't their data so they want to put it into the context of what they know.

## Purpose-seeking

In these codes, participants infer a bigger picture or task.

### Participants want to uncover the purpose: “Why is the file system organized like this?,” “what are the power stations doing?”
  - Make a story/context for the file system: 
    - [Session 006](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kj4nt/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

### Participants want to discover ultima: For power plant, which one produces the most energy?   
  - Supported by:
    - [Session 011](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kaemj/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

    - [Session 008](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/47sng/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)

### Participants suggest or assume other tasks
  - Take inventory

  - Cleaning
    - [Session 019](https://osf.io/z3j9f/) 
  - Carrying
    - [Session 022](https://osf.io/psv9g/)

    - [Session 029](https://osf.io/bph2d/)
  - Math problem
    - [Session 031](https://osf.io/cy3s4/)

### Participants suggest source of data, such as all being part of a toolbox
  - [Session 007](https://osf.io/kxze2/) - stationary drawer
  - [Session 010](https://osf.io/kedv9/) - office supplies
  - [Session 013](https://osf.io/bgeh9/) - toolbox, electrician's toolbox
  - [Session 016](https://osf.io/d4efp/) - office supplies
  - [Session 017](https://osf.io/qmts9/) - municipal or power company guide
  - [Session 020](https://osf.io/5rsjc/) - comes from residential part of city
  - [Session 021](https://osf.io/v4nmf/) - relation suggested but unknown
  - [Session 022](https://osf.io/psv9g/) - office supplies
  - [Session 024](https://osf.io/742fb/) - comes from residentail neighborhood
  - [Session 028](https://osf.io/4u63n/) - office items, pre-sorted
  - [Session 030](https://osf.io/9jxy3/) - organization of some program

## The idea that data relates to computers is prevalent: 
  - [Session 010](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kgv76/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render) wrote a Python dictionary. 
  - Participants used file system icons that they cited as being from an operating system.
    - [Session 006](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/kj4nt/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 009](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/6n7pa/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 012](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/4aphc/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
    - [Session 015](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/y487f/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render)
  - Reliance on tables: 
    - Session 007: 
      Me: "Did it surprise you that we called it a data set?" 

      S: I was expecting something more structured, maybe like a table or something. I guess I was expecting a table. Because that’s the most common form of storing data, like a spreadsheet or table, something like that. I guess this a valid data set, it’s got objects and quantities for those objects.  
    - Session 014: 
      N: "For instance, there was apartments, there was houses, there was homes, there were warehouses so the first thing I thought in my mind was how to arrange those in a table in order to get an idea of how much power each house or apartment would generate or require."



## Physical objects can also be used to represent data
  - Their organization (e.g. orientation, appearance, affordances) is based on the real world

    - Appearance: based on / tied to memories
      - [Session 013](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/dgzrs/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): the pencils, etc. 
      - [Session 008](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/47sng/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): the cooling towers 

    - Affordances: 
      - [Session 015](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/y487f/?direct%26mode=render%26action=download%26mode=render): “physical” folder, issue of running out of space, words about putting things into the folder and it becoming out of shape

## Participants tend to draw things in order of reading.
  - Often, but not always, this order reflects itself on the page
    - Support: File System and Power Station tend to be drawn in order of reading
      - Session 26: intentionally gave the participant the power stations in non-alphabetical order. They drew a table, rows in alphabetical order, and then filled in the cells in read-order (not alphabetically).
    - Against: junk drawer examples. We see organization on the page that is not related to the read-order but instead related to the physical objects
      - 016-B-bonus.jpg: this user came up with ways to arrange the data based on attributes that they added
