## Codes and categories should be written as first-level headers
  - Discrete supporting evidence
  - (or codes associated with categories)
  - are listed as distinct bullet points

Codes
=====
## Participants often want to add additional information, data that isn’t there
  - Impose structure/hierarchy: for the junk drawer, some participants group items (Session 013, Session 007). For the file system, a participant wanted to add names that reflected a folder hierarchy (Session 012)
  - Add data to each item: for the file system, a participant wanted to add the file sizes (Session 009). For the power plants, participants want to reduce down to the number of people or to the number of individual units (Session 014)
  - Observation by KI: Want to add a 'richness' to the data in lots of dimensions. This isn't their data so they want to put it into the context of what they know.

## Participants want to uncover the purpose: “Why is the file system organized like this?,” “what are the power stations doing?”
  - Make a story/context for the file system: Session 006, Session 009, Session 012

## Participants want to discover ultima: For power plant, which one produces the most energy?   
  - Supported by Session 011, Session 014, not Session 008

## The idea that data relates to computers is prevalent: 
  - Session 010 wrote a Python dictionary. 
  - Sessions 006, 009, 012, 015 used file system icons that they cited as being from an operating system.
  - Reliance on tables: Session 007 (“I guess .. table”) and Session 014

## Physical objects can also be used to represent data
  - Their organization (e.g. orientation, appearance, affordances) is based on the real world
    - Appearance: based on / tied to memories (the pencils etc for Session 013, the cooling towers for Session 008)
    - Affordances: “physical” folder in Session 015, issue of running out of space, words about putting things into the folder and it becoming out of shape
