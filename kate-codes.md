https://osf.io/kj4nt/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, imagines manila folders, similar to "Windows"
- As the dataset is read, in head organizes first one on the "left"
- As the dataset is read, thinks of things in levels already


- Draws a node-link hierarchy with orthogonal edges
- Uses different icons for the different types (squiggles for text files,
  photo for pictures)
- Root is only added during discussion
- Talks about things being "connected to but beneath" and needing to "link
  them"

- They want to re-organize this data by type ("have all the text files in one
  folder and maybe all the photos in one folder")

- They note they got this idea from growing up with computers, using Win98 and
  XP, and thus their file system/structure makes the most sense for them
- During hte process, they say that they're imagining the containing folder
  for the first two. They appear to be describing the icon view in the Windows
file system.
- NOTE: There is no view in Win98 or XP that looks like what they've drawn!!
- They seem to navigate the hierarchy as it is said
- Has high affinity for computers, grew up with them, was a lingist but now an
  IT administrator, and now a CS major
- 28yo CS major, always visualizes data due to their classes, sometimes as a
  hobby (is in computer organization, discrete structures, calc II, and web
development --- no vis!)

- CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the faciliator (circling folders)

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kxze2/ (notes)
https://osf.io/hsy7q/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, tries to "visualize that drawer" and also tries to
  figure out what goes in what container in the drawer.

- They started drawing the big outline (rectangle/drawer) and then added stuff
  from left to write. It sounds like they draw in a hierarchical way...
drawing the drawer, then the containers, then the contents.
  - They ran out of room to put the sharpies in the pouch so then they don't
    put them in there. They note this as they do it.
- Has a lot of detail in explanation on how the drawer would work (where the
  knobs and edge  would be)
- Is concerned at how neatly things are stacked.
- Makes logical associations between some of the items, like putting the
  stamps with the envelopes.
- Notes they drew the pencils unsharpened -- extra state information
  - Note to self: CODE: more "filling in information that's not there"
- They note the junk drawer is actually pretty clean all tings conisdered

- They note the contents seems reasonable for a stationary drawer.
- They note when we said "data set" they expected something more structured,
  like a table or spreadsheet, since that'
  - CODE: Expectation that data is tabular
- They note however that this is a valid dataset because it has objects and
  quantities for those objects (??)
- They however chose this depiction over a table because they have a similar
  drawer at home and were thinking about it.
- Their mental model maintained constant because they were thinking about
  their own drawer.
  - CODE: Arrangement is highly personal (see also: sock drawer)

- 20yo CS/MIS major, has not used D3, but has used Power BI and Tableau, though
  not often, just for class... however, likes to visualize in their head while
they read it. 
  - Thinks of stock market increases as a graph (line graph?)
    - Stocks come up in their MIS degree
    - Tries to visualize how much the ups and downs are in terms of scale
  - Also visualizes tree traversals

Power plans

https://osf.io/47sng/ (notes)
https://osf.io/47sng/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, they note it sounds like a maths problem
  - In their head, they think of the actual physical power plans and buildings

- While drawing, comes up with icons for building types. Seems like power
  station is a cooling tower with a rectangle. Warehouse they say is a "big,
giant, two or three story building" and raws a rectangular prism. Also draws
houses in 3D.
  - Develop different iconography for different types of buildings
    - CODE: Catagoriacl icongraphy very popular
    - Note to self: circle back to the idea of data losing its connection to
      reality
- Uses 3D at first but then switches to 2D
- Apartment complex based off of one friends live in
  - CODE: Relating directly to personal
    - also notes that power plants based on those back home and in engineering
      students text books, warehouse based on Amazon warehouse.

- Notes they would explain his drawing just like it was written without the
  drawing. Huh.
  - Interesting that they don't explain the drawing, but instead explains teh
    data.
  - Seems to be trying to immediately answer some questions about the data "So
    I guess D is proving the most power?"
    - CODE: Naturally seeking tasks
- Notes they don't know what kind of power plants they are
  - CODE: Naturally seeking extra data/information/attributes

- Mental model remained the same but then they "got lazy" with the rendering
  - They were still imagining the same things but just drawing it more
    abstractly
  - CODE: Uh... abstractions? mental model vs. depictions

- 21yo CS/Math major, really likes looking at choropleth maps (thought didn't
  know teh term), always tries to visualize first when they hear of data but
doesn't work with data that often.
  - Map interest may stem from childhood, because they had a aworld maps in
    their diaries and stuff

https://osf.io/6n7pa/ (drawing)

(Wow, i thought the drawing was power plants)

- On hearing the dataset: "obviously a folder structure" with nested
  information. Already discusses what they would show in termsof links


- Draws each of the first two folders as big rectangles with small "txt" files
  inside, drawing left to right. The imgs the same way.
  - Note that each type is in its own row left to right
    - CODE: Arrangement
- They say they will be lazy and stop labeling the text files iwht "txt" and
  instead just use color to differentiate them. Oh wait, the colors only came
later while they were explaining what they drew.
  - CODE: Abstraction as they continue
  - CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the facilitator
- They make the code files ".java"
  - CODE: Adding extra information
- They draw nested folders at the same level, but use a link from one icon to
  the folder to indicate the relationship.
- They claim this is "pretty standardized for computers"

- They note they don't know the text file sizes so they drew them all the same
  size to represent that htey're ther.
  - CODE: Requesting extra attributes/info
  - CODE: Icon representations
- They note they color them in because they're pretty
- They use the langauge "reference" to just say they're somewhere even if you
  don't know how big they are.


- They note that they do not know the relationship between teh first and
  second folder. They do not assume they belong in the same folder. This is
different from others. 
- They try to relate the contents to the structure of a program
  - CODE: Relate to something they know
  - CODE: Finding tasks: try to figure out what the dataset "relaly is"


- They note they based their drawing on computers which they have been using
  since childhood and call their drawing "pretty standard"
  - Notes they could separate by type on different operating systems
- They say they've seen something like this before in organizing files for a
  website, but note they could be overassuming
  - CODE: Try to guess the outer context, or something they know, and organize
    that way

- When asked to draw with sizes, switches to a stacked bar chart organized by
  file type.
  - Drawing reminds them of chocolate bar :)
  - On second promprt, said it reminds them of hard drive fragmentation
    visualization

- 24yo software developer & CS major w/previous neuroscience degree
  - does visualization w/database queries for reports
  - neuroscience was more bar charts

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kedv9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kgv76/ (drawing)

- Short due to mic problems

- Have two representation, the first is JSON-like and the second is a weighted
  node-link diagram (second was added in discussion)
  - JSON was key-value with the value being the number of items listed

- Upon hearing the data description noted it was a lot of office supplies

- in interview aftwerwards they confirmed that they related "data" to
  computers
  - CODE: "Data" is something computer-y
- They noted the large number of items
- They noted they had seen this kind of organization in Python and their CS 2
  course. 
  - CODE: Familiarity from elsewhere with this kind of representation
- They considerd what they call a "web format" which is the node-link diagram
  they then drew.

- 18yo CS major, sometimes visualizes data

Power Stations

https://osf.io/qj2pm/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kaemj/ (drawing)

- their drawing is columns of ABC... and rows of house types with a legend on
  the side with the actual numbers.
  - CODE: Arrangement

- WHen read the dataset, said they thought about how much power needed to be
  output
  - CODE: Sets a task/likely problem to solve

- WHen drawing, they first started with a box and then made the rows and
  columns. 
  - Note: Seems like they were trying to come up with a regular organization to
    me


- In explaining it, they note that the size of the box encodes the size of the
  dwelling
  - CODE: Size encoding
- They note the legend/list exists for them to keep track of everything
  - Note: Did they need this / do this because they thought they wouldn't get
    a copy?
  - CODE (Possible depending on earlier question): In-progress
    organization/arrangement before final one, SECOND CODE: Arrangement

- What stuck out: They answer which power station has to be the biggest
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve
- Claims they try to solve the problem because they wanted to assign purpose
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve -- purpose-seeking
- Adds that Power Station F would be the lowest
  - Note: They really went after that task!

- They say they come up with the idea from math problems
  - CODE: Second person to associate this with math/optimizaiton
- They drew boxes because drawing houses would be too much effort
  - CODE: Abstractions, SECOND CODE: Effort

- They bring up some of the scale comparison visualizations like Bezos' wealth
  and the size of astronomical bodies
  - CODE: Size encoding, SECOND CODE: seen something like it before

- 18yo CS major, sometimes visualizes but doesn't like doing it but looks at
  other people's visualizations

File System

https://osf.io/xbw3h/ (notes)
https://osf.io/4aphc/ (drawing)

- drawing is a left-right tidy-esque node link diagram with two source nodes
  (a forest), there is a sub-hierarchy by file type.
  - CODE: file system as tree, SUB-CODE: left-right tree
  - CODE: imposed hierarchy, new hierarchy nodes added for file type
  - CODE: physical icons
  - CODE: icons used in this space before (familiar with Windows)
- There is an added edge at the bottom that the faciliator suggests may be
  about reorganizing the data
  - CODE: Annotation
- There are other annotations about interacting with and uses as well
  - CODE: Annotation
  - CODE: Desire for more data/info

- On having the data set read to them, they associate ith with computers and
  suggest a CS major may have done it. They then explain it/critique it in
terms of organizing a software project.
  - CODE: Assumption this is from a software project
  - CODE: Trying to determine the higher level structure/purpose
  - CODE: (wanting) Arrangement by categorical type 

- Participant notes it's hard to draw exactly what's in their head
  - CODE: Limitation of drawing capability, head != representation
- Participant says they think of the file explorer
  - CODE: file system through file explorer
  - CODE: participant notes drawing cannot be interactive

- Participant is asked about their concerns with organization
  - CODE: arrangement
- Participant says they thought about how they arrange things
  - CODE: arrangement is very personal
  - CODE: relationship to something they know

- 19yo CS major & TA + biochem major
  - notes whether htey visualize data depends on what one considers data
    - CODE: whether something is data or not
  - does some visualization for personal convenience
  - has made some charts in biochem

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/bgeh9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dgzrs/ (drawing)

- drawing appears to use color and be done with a digital drawing program.
- drawing represents objects in good facsimile to what they are
  - CODE: physical representations / life-like drawings
- pens are in pencil case, small things are in basket
  - CODE: junk drawer containment imposed
- stamps are near envelopes
  - CODE: organization, arrangment
- colors and details added later
  - CODE: embellishment
- they discuss how / why they chose representations they did, relating back to
  objects they have seen before (e.g., third grade stamps (line 2), what their
parents had (line 4)). Each object has a personal story and memory.
  - CODE: relations to personal, real life

- while dataset being written, participant notes as the items came thought it
  was a home toolbox, but when pens came, thought it was an electricians
toolbox
  - CODE: Trying to see bigger picture behind dataset

- participant discusses ways you can pair the different data (line 19 -
  envelopes/stamps, rubber bands/tacks, pens/pencils/sharpener/pouch) then
says the basket doesn't have a pair which is why it stuck out
  - CODE: arrangement by sets/grouping
  - CODE: outlier as a singleton set

- participant focused on the individual represenation (line 24) in terms of
  which to draw
  - CODE: physical/life-like representations

- 19yo CS/Info Science major works at Global Center, sometiems visualizes
  things

Power Stations

https://osf.io/gzw56/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dm3ak/ (drawings)

- after having the dataset read, the participant asks whether the emphasis is
  on the data set not the data "containing in it"
  - Note: I wonder what that means, is it thinking of the whole versus the
    parts?
  - CODE (possibly): whole dataset versus data items
- facilitator notes the emphasis is on how they think about the data and
  organize it in their head. participant repeats that the details are not
important, but the organization. Facilitators says its however it makes sense
to them.
- participant does say their initial reaction was what the answer was
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
    - Note: It does seem like while we see this in a lot of places, it is most
      prevalent with the power station dataset and least with the junk drawer
but I would have to double check that after seeing all the data
- participant says they thought about how they might arrange the details in a
  table to get an idea of how much power was required, based on their task
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
  - CODE: table arrangement

- participant draws a node-link diagram showing how power stations connect to
  the different types of buildings and then how the apartment connects to
residents
  - Note: while presumably houses would have residents, the resdients only
    appears connect to the apartment, perhaps because how the data was read
  - CODE: power station, either graph or hierarchy, unclear, left-right
- participant then draws a table with rows for A..F and columns for the types
  of buildings including resdients. The A...F is hte power station column.
They do not add details but say this is how they thought in their mind
  - CODE: power station, table
  - CODE: abstracting away implied details

- participants talks about the types of data they have (e.g., categories) and
  also how specific they are in their connections to types of buildings. Talks
about residents in apartments as a parameter
  - CODE: Casting into a data typology
- participant has hexperience with Python, seaborne, and matplotlib and says
  as such they are used to different types of data and prioritizing some
features, so they were applying that background in data analysis
  - CODE: link to what they know
  - CODE: data organization from/for data analysis tools
- line 15: talks about how much power each type of building needs (the prompt
  was what was powering the most things, but participant converted the rpboem)
  - CODE: wanting other atributes (in this case, power draw)
- line 17: talks about residents and buildings as "end points" that draw power
- line 19 & 23: talks about encpsulating all three different parameters and begins
  drawings/talking through it again. This is the node-link drawing with
operations on the edges at the bottom fo teh sheet
  - CODE: Using drawing to explain to facilitator
  - CODE: expression tree (?) as a node-link diagram, left-right
  - CODE: More suggesting data / format wanted to solve a problem

- when asked what htey noticed, participant said the layered-strcture of the
  data
  - CODE: layers/hierarchy in power station

- when asked what this is like previously, participant talked about chart
  types for algorithm development and also mind map techniques for laying out
connections on paper
  - CODE: related to prior things seen/strategies used

- mental model did not change until problem statement
  - CODE: mental model consistent (need to go back and code the yes/no/maybe
    for this question for everything before!)
  - CODE: introduction of task changed mental model, but it was still quite
    similar

- 21yo cs & infoscience major, sometimes visualizes things
