Filesystem

https://osf.io/pkqsm/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kj4nt/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, imagines manila folders, similar to "Windows"
- As the dataset is read, in head organizes first one on the "left"
- As the dataset is read, thinks of things in levels already


- Draws a node-link hierarchy with orthogonal edges
- Uses different icons for the different types (squiggles for text files,
  photo for pictures)
- Root is only added during discussion
- Talks about things being "connected to but beneath" and needing to "link
  them"

- They want to re-organize this data by type ("have all the text files in one
  folder and maybe all the photos in one folder")

- They note they got this idea from growing up with computers, using Win98 and
  XP, and thus their file system/structure makes the most sense for them
- During hte process, they say that they're imagining the containing folder
  for the first two. They appear to be describing the icon view in the Windows
file system.
- NOTE: There is no view in Win98 or XP that looks like what they've drawn!!
- They seem to navigate the hierarchy as it is said
- Has high affinity for computers, grew up with them, was a lingist but now an
  IT administrator, and now a CS major
- 28yo CS major, always visualizes data due to their classes, sometimes as a
  hobby (is in computer organization, discrete structures, calc II, and web
development --- no vis!)

- CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the faciliator (circling folders)

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kxze2/ (notes)
https://osf.io/hsy7q/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, tries to "visualize that drawer" and also tries to
  figure out what goes in what container in the drawer.

- They started drawing the big outline (rectangle/drawer) and then added stuff
  from left to write. It sounds like they draw in a hierarchical way...
drawing the drawer, then the containers, then the contents.
  - They ran out of room to put the sharpies in the pouch so then they don't
    put them in there. They note this as they do it.
- Has a lot of detail in explanation on how the drawer would work (where the
  knobs and edge  would be)
- Is concerned at how neatly things are stacked.
- Makes logical associations between some of the items, like putting the
  stamps with the envelopes.
- Notes they drew the pencils unsharpened -- extra state information
  - Note to self: CODE: more "filling in information that's not there"
- They note the junk drawer is actually pretty clean all tings conisdered

- They note the contents seems reasonable for a stationary drawer.
- They note when we said "data set" they expected something more structured,
  like a table or spreadsheet, since that'
  - CODE: Expectation that data is tabular
- They note however that this is a valid dataset because it has objects and
  quantities for those objects (??)
- They however chose this depiction over a table because they have a similar
  drawer at home and were thinking about it.
- Their mental model maintained constant because they were thinking about
  their own drawer.
  - CODE: Arrangement is highly personal (see also: sock drawer)

- 20yo CS/MIS major, has not used D3, but has used Power BI and Tableau, though
  not often, just for class... however, likes to visualize in their head while
they read it. 
  - Thinks of stock market increases as a graph (line graph?)
    - Stocks come up in their MIS degree
    - Tries to visualize how much the ups and downs are in terms of scale
  - Also visualizes tree traversals

Power plans

https://osf.io/47sng/ (notes)
https://osf.io/47sng/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, they note it sounds like a maths problem
  - In their head, they think of the actual physical power plans and buildings

- While drawing, comes up with icons for building types. Seems like power
  station is a cooling tower with a rectangle. Warehouse they say is a "big,
giant, two or three story building" and raws a rectangular prism. Also draws
houses in 3D.
  - Develop different iconography for different types of buildings
    - CODE: Catagoriacl icongraphy very popular
    - Note to self: circle back to the idea of data losing its connection to
      reality
- Uses 3D at first but then switches to 2D
- Apartment complex based off of one friends live in
  - CODE: Relating directly to personal
    - also notes that power plants based on those back home and in engineering
      students text books, warehouse based on Amazon warehouse.

- Notes they would explain his drawing just like it was written without the
  drawing. Huh.
  - Interesting that they don't explain the drawing, but instead explains teh
    data.
  - Seems to be trying to immediately answer some questions about the data "So
    I guess D is proving the most power?"
    - CODE: Naturally seeking tasks
- Notes they don't know what kind of power plants they are
  - CODE: Naturally seeking extra data/information/attributes

- Mental model remained the same but then they "got lazy" with the rendering
  - They were still imagining the same things but just drawing it more
    abstractly
  - CODE: Uh... abstractions? mental model vs. depictions

- 21yo CS/Math major, really likes looking at choropleth maps (thought didn't
  know teh term), always tries to visualize first when they hear of data but
doesn't work with data that often.
  - Map interest may stem from childhood, because they had a aworld maps in
    their diaries and stuff

File System


https://osf.io/es7w6/ (notes)
https://osf.io/6n7pa/ (drawing)

(Wow, i thought the drawing was power plants)

- On hearing the dataset: "obviously a folder structure" with nested
  information. Already discusses what they would show in termsof links


- Draws each of the first two folders as big rectangles with small "txt" files
  inside, drawing left to right. The imgs the same way.
  - Note that each type is in its own row left to right
    - CODE: Arrangement
- They say they will be lazy and stop labeling the text files iwht "txt" and
  instead just use color to differentiate them. Oh wait, the colors only came
later while they were explaining what they drew.
  - CODE: Abstraction as they continue
  - CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the facilitator
- They make the code files ".java"
  - CODE: Adding extra information
- They draw nested folders at the same level, but use a link from one icon to
  the folder to indicate the relationship.
- They claim this is "pretty standardized for computers"

- They note they don't know the text file sizes so they drew them all the same
  size to represent that htey're ther.
  - CODE: Requesting extra attributes/info
  - CODE: Icon representations
- They note they color them in because they're pretty
- They use the langauge "reference" to just say they're somewhere even if you
  don't know how big they are.


- They note that they do not know the relationship between teh first and
  second folder. They do not assume they belong in the same folder. This is
different from others. 
- They try to relate the contents to the structure of a program
  - CODE: Relate to something they know
  - CODE: Finding tasks: try to figure out what the dataset "relaly is"


- They note they based their drawing on computers which they have been using
  since childhood and call their drawing "pretty standard"
  - Notes they could separate by type on different operating systems
- They say they've seen something like this before in organizing files for a
  website, but note they could be overassuming
  - CODE: Try to guess the outer context, or something they know, and organize
    that way

- When asked to draw with sizes, switches to a stacked bar chart organized by
  file type.
  - Drawing reminds them of chocolate bar :)
  - On second promprt, said it reminds them of hard drive fragmentation
    visualization

- 24yo software developer & CS major w/previous neuroscience degree
  - does visualization w/database queries for reports
  - neuroscience was more bar charts

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kedv9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kgv76/ (drawing)

- Short due to mic problems

- Have two representation, the first is JSON-like and the second is a weighted
  node-link diagram (second was added in discussion)
  - JSON was key-value with the value being the number of items listed

- Upon hearing the data description noted it was a lot of office supplies

- in interview aftwerwards they confirmed that they related "data" to
  computers
  - CODE: "Data" is something computer-y
- They noted the large number of items
- They noted they had seen this kind of organization in Python and their CS 2
  course. 
  - CODE: Familiarity from elsewhere with this kind of representation
- They considerd what they call a "web format" which is the node-link diagram
  they then drew.

- 18yo CS major, sometimes visualizes data

Power Stations

https://osf.io/qj2pm/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kaemj/ (drawing)

- their drawing is columns of ABC... and rows of house types with a legend on
  the side with the actual numbers.
  - CODE: Arrangement

- WHen read the dataset, said they thought about how much power needed to be
  output
  - CODE: Sets a task/likely problem to solve

- WHen drawing, they first started with a box and then made the rows and
  columns. 
  - Note: Seems like they were trying to come up with a regular organization to
    me


- In explaining it, they note that the size of the box encodes the size of the
  dwelling
  - CODE: Size encoding
- They note the legend/list exists for them to keep track of everything
  - Note: Did they need this / do this because they thought they wouldn't get
    a copy?
  - CODE (Possible depending on earlier question): In-progress
    organization/arrangement before final one, SECOND CODE: Arrangement

- What stuck out: They answer which power station has to be the biggest
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve
- Claims they try to solve the problem because they wanted to assign purpose
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve -- purpose-seeking
- Adds that Power Station F would be the lowest
  - Note: They really went after that task!

- They say they come up with the idea from math problems
  - CODE: Second person to associate this with math/optimizaiton
- They drew boxes because drawing houses would be too much effort
  - CODE: Abstractions, SECOND CODE: Effort

- They bring up some of the scale comparison visualizations like Bezos' wealth
  and the size of astronomical bodies
  - CODE: Size encoding, SECOND CODE: seen something like it before

- 18yo CS major, sometimes visualizes but doesn't like doing it but looks at
  other people's visualizations

File System

https://osf.io/xbw3h/ (notes)
https://osf.io/4aphc/ (drawing)

- drawing is a left-right tidy-esque node link diagram with two source nodes
  (a forest), there is a sub-hierarchy by file type.
  - CODE: file system as tree, SUB-CODE: left-right tree
  - CODE: imposed hierarchy, new hierarchy nodes added for file type
  - CODE: physical icons
  - CODE: icons used in this space before (familiar with Windows)
- There is an added edge at the bottom that the faciliator suggests may be
  about reorganizing the data
  - CODE: Annotation
- There are other annotations about interacting with and uses as well
  - CODE: Annotation
  - CODE: Desire for more data/info

- On having the data set read to them, they associate ith with computers and
  suggest a CS major may have done it. They then explain it/critique it in
terms of organizing a software project.
  - CODE: Assumption this is from a software project
  - CODE: Trying to determine the higher level structure/purpose
  - CODE: (wanting) Arrangement by categorical type 

- Participant notes it's hard to draw exactly what's in their head
  - CODE: Limitation of drawing capability, head != representation
- Participant says they think of the file explorer
  - CODE: file system through file explorer
  - CODE: participant notes drawing cannot be interactive

- Participant is asked about their concerns with organization
  - CODE: arrangement
- Participant says they thought about how they arrange things
  - CODE: arrangement is very personal
  - CODE: relationship to something they know

- 19yo CS major & TA + biochem major
  - notes whether htey visualize data depends on what one considers data
    - CODE: whether something is data or not
  - does some visualization for personal convenience
  - has made some charts in biochem

https://osf.io/bgeh9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dgzrs/ (drawing)

- drawing appears to use color and be done with a digital drawing program.
- drawing represents objects in good facsimile to what they are
  - CODE: physical representations / life-like drawings
- pens are in pencil case, small things are in basket
  - CODE: junk drawer containment imposed
- stamps are near envelopes
  - CODE: organization, arrangment
- colors and details added later
  - CODE: embellishment
- they discuss how / why they chose representations they did, relating back to
  objects they have seen before (e.g., third grade stamps (line 2), what their
parents had (line 4)). Each object has a personal story and memory.
  - CODE: relations to personal, real life

- while dataset being written, participant notes as the items came thought it
  was a home toolbox, but when pens came, thought it was an electricians
toolbox
  - CODE: Trying to see bigger picture behind dataset

- participant discusses ways you can pair the different data (line 19 -
  envelopes/stamps, rubber bands/tacks, pens/pencils/sharpener/pouch) then
says the basket doesn't have a pair which is why it stuck out
  - CODE: arrangement by sets/grouping
  - CODE: outlier as a singleton set

- participant focused on the individual represenation (line 24) in terms of
  which to draw
  - CODE: physical/life-like representations

Power Stations

https://osf.io/gzw56/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dm3ak/ (drawings)

- after having the dataset read, the participant asks whether the emphasis is
  on the data set not the data "containing in it"
  - Note: I wonder what that means, is it thinking of the whole versus the
    parts?
  - CODE (possibly): whole dataset versus data items
- facilitator notes the emphasis is on how they think about the data and
  organize it in their head. participant repeats that the details are not
important, but the organization. Facilitators says its however it makes sense
to them.
- participant does say their initial reaction was what the answer was
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
    - Note: It does seem like while we see this in a lot of places, it is most
      prevalent with the power station dataset and least with the junk drawer
but I would have to double check that after seeing all the data
- participant says they thought about how they might arrange the details in a
  table to get an idea of how much power was required, based on their task
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
  - CODE: table arrangement

- participant draws a node-link diagram showing how power stations connect to
  the different types of buildings and then how the apartment connects to
residents
  - Note: while presumably houses would have residents, the resdients only
    appears connect to the apartment, perhaps because how the data was read
  - CODE: power station, either graph or hierarchy, unclear, left-right
- participant then draws a table with rows for A..F and columns for the types
  of buildings including resdients. The A...F is hte power station column.
They do not add details but say this is how they thought in their mind
  - CODE: power station, table
  - CODE: abstracting away implied details

- participants talks about the types of data they have (e.g., categories) and
  also how specific they are in their connections to types of buildings. Talks
about residents in apartments as a parameter
  - CODE: Casting into a data typology
- participant has hexperience with Python, seaborne, and matplotlib and says
  as such they are used to different types of data and prioritizing some
features, so they were applying that background in data analysis
  - CODE: link to what they know
  - CODE: data organization from/for data analysis tools
- line 15: talks about how much power each type of building needs (the prompt
  was what was powering the most things, but participant converted the rpboem)
  - CODE: wanting other atributes (in this case, power draw)
- line 17: talks about residents and buildings as "end points" that draw power
- line 19 & 23: talks about encpsulating all three different parameters and begins
  drawings/talking through it again. This is the node-link drawing with
operations on the edges at the bottom fo teh sheet
  - CODE: Using drawing to explain to facilitator
  - CODE: expression tree (?) as a node-link diagram, left-right
  - CODE: More suggesting data / format wanted to solve a problem

- when asked what htey noticed, participant said the layered-strcture of the
  data
  - CODE: layers/hierarchy in power station

- when asked what this is like previously, participant talked about chart
  types for algorithm development and also mind map techniques for laying out
connections on paper
  - CODE: related to prior things seen/strategies used

- mental model did not change until problem statement
  - CODE: mental model consistent (need to go back and code the yes/no/maybe
    for this question for everything before!)
  - CODE: introduction of task changed mental model, but it was still quite
    similar

File System

https://osf.io/zn6qj/ (notes)
https://osf.io/y487f/ (drawing)

- when asked initial intuition during reading they said they visualize drawers
  for folders and paper for files
  - CODE: imagine as physical objects


- participant tried to memorize data so the facilitator suggested they write
  it down which they do as a list for each top level folder and an arrow for
the nested one
  - CODE: file system, indented tree
- participant clarifies how a folder can be inside a folder and says they have
  to reimagine that.
- participant says they shift to imagining the icons in Windows
  - CODE: Liken to existing file system iconography
- participant draws with physical nested folders though, in 3D-ish perspective
  - CODE: physical objects
- participant shades text files to differentiate them from other types of
  files
  - CODE: encoding type with color

- when explaining the image, the participant talks about how sheets/files
  would be right next to each other
  - CODE: constraints of physical objects
- facilitator asks why different kinds of markings for the same type and
  participant explains that they could show it at first but then constraints
of occlusion forced them to use labels later
  - CODE: encoding changes forced by space

- participant finds nested folder strange
  - CODE: violation of mental model sticks out

- when asked about the idea, participant refers to windows icons. 
  - Note: I have seen windows icons like this with the folder on the side and
    its showing that there's stuff in there, not sure when those came into
Windows. I assume this doesn't hint that there are folders inside
  - CODE: inspired by OS iconography

- participant says they don't think their mental model changed, but it *did*
  change because they had to fit it all and that caused rearrangement
  - CODE: mental model at a high level did not change
  - CODE: arrangement
- when asked about crossing out adn starting over, participant said they would
  probably keep doing it again and again so they preferred to get the main
thing sketched and once it was good they could always draw a better version
  - CODE: figure out in place

- 21yo CS major, sometimes does visualizations for school... like trees and
  digraphs

https://osf.io/d4efp/ (notes)
https://osf.io/4reuj/ (drawing)

- On having dataset read, participant notes that items are broken out by
category, that they're office supplies, and the data is discrete
  - CODE: Data typology seen (discrete)
  - CODE: Higher level idea inferred (office supplies)

- Writes labels left to write
  - CODE: Left to right
- Writes in order tha thtings are in the dataset
  - CODE: Dataset list order
- Has to wrap around to fit all labels
  - CODE: Run out of space

- On explaining, suggests they could have grouped some of the items (e.g., the
  baskets) together
  - CODE: Grouping

- When asked what sticks out, notes it felt like the list may have been
  ordered by quantitity
  - CODE: Inferring ordering meaning
- Participant discusses cost of items
  - CODE: Pondering about extra attributes

- Participant notes they work with bar graphs often
  - CODE: Familiarity from life with representation
- Participant notes how they reorganized the names to fit inventory better
  with how they might have been done in the military - nouns first, then
adjectives
  - CODE: Familiarty from real life
  - CODE: identification of nouns and adjectives -- posibbly a typology?
    - Note: How diverse the typologies?

- Participant said that while they were drawing, they thought of a better way
  to organize: by price
  - CODE: arrangement, price order
  - CODE: extra attributes
  - CODE: inferring tasks

- Participant draws second version as the inventory they were speaking of
  (partially to show how they would do it)
  - https://osf.io/u5dge/ (drawing)
- They add X for expendible and D for durable
  - CODE: extra attributes

- Participant talks about how they try to articulate a story such that someone
  else can repeat it in an understandable way and sometimes data gets in the
way of it! (line 31)
  - CODE: story-telling, main point
  - CODE: communication/collaboration
  - CODE: data as a distraction

- 35yo in Sales, uses financial modeling and charts to try to show customer
  value, visualizes often
  - previously platoon leader in engineering company, inventory was a big deal


General Note: This repeated desire for more attributes fights with the desire
to simplify things for the story. I feel like this has something to say about
why data can get wide in attributes but also how much of it people may want to
know at once?

Power Stations

https://osf.io/qmts9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/rqxab/ (drawing)

- Upon being read the dataset, their intuition is that it might be from a
  municipal guide/power company guide. They ask if that's intuition.
  - Note: Is the wording here biasing people to try to see the larger picture?
  - CODE: trying to infer larger picture of data or its source


- Participants notes their discomfort with drawing, notes that they will go
  with how they wrote it as it was being read
  - Note: This may be related to the ordering/arrangement we see
- Participant writes things in a table of power station letters (rows) and
  building types (columns) with numbers at intersections. The intersections
have multipliers for the people in the apartments. Note the column headings
were added by prompting.
  - CODE: Tables for power station
- Partiipant says if the city was noted, they would understand it
  - CODE: desire for more data, source requested

- Participant refers to the drawing as a "graph"
  - CODE: tables are a graph!
- Participant says they put the residential buildings first then the
  commercial/industrial warehouse
  - CODE: arrangement by type
- Participant is asked about how they handled separating the number of
  participants and the number of residents. Participant brings up that homes
can have numbers of people and thus that's necessary
  - CODE: preparing for data not given

- When asked what sticks out, participant notes the power stations do not
  serve many homes and wonders why, could it be renewables?
  - CODE: Smell testing teh data
- Participant verifies they have experience with renewables and was on town's
  energy commission
  - CODE: Relating to waht they know from real life

- Participant said they hadn't seen it before, it just made sense to them
  - CODE: Does not relate to a prior visualization

- Participant said mental model did not really change, even when further
  prompted

- It seems they read the description rather than having it read to them or
  read it before talking about their gut reaction.
- They said they had trouble understanding whether the last sentence referered
  to a new folder on the one previous
- They said they thought of something nested
  - CODE: Nesting
  - Note: I really need to go through and match gut reaction to what they said
    their mental model was and what the drew. I may need to make a table

- Starts in top left
  - CODE: drawing left to right
- Draws an indented tree (see figure), one folder at a time, with inidivudal
  items for the different text and image files
  - CODE: file system similar to indented tree, SUB-CODE: left-right
    indetneded tree
  - Note: People seem to naturally draw the individual items most of the time,
    but not always (see inventory in P17) We should also keep track of this

- On explanation, uses the term "sets"
  - CODE: sets
- They also named the two folders, A and B, to tell them apart, as well as the
  files
  - CODE: assigns IDs
- Second level are assigned numbers along with the type
  - CODE: assigns IDs, develops naming system (possible code name: "develops
    schema")
- They note they have some files wiht the same name, so its really the nesting
  path and the name that is unique. They consider this a potential problem
  - CODE: uniqueness considered
  - CODE: possible edits 


- Participant says they were inspired for this diea by the code they do at
  their job, and coming up with naming systems and access in JSON
  - CODE: related to personal life
- Faciliator asks about curly braces. Participant says they considered it
  - CODE: related to personal life

- Participant said mental model did not change
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- Facilitator discusses the difference between Apple and Windows expectations

- Facilitator asks about not using icons. Participants says they're used to
  variables instead

- if they had done it a second time, would have put all writing implements in
  the pencil pouch, small items in small tray, and enveloes in big tray... or
possibly stack all in tray
  - CODE: nesting in containers

- they said their mental model changed in thinking about what the writing
  implements looked like (or is this drawing what they looked like) but
otherwise did not change
  - CODE: mental model didn't change
  - CODE: representation needed to change to distinguish categories

- asked how they would communicate it to someone else if that were the task,
  htey said they would probably do it as lists of things that can fit in the
various containers (line 20)
  - CODE: arrangement by size, arrangement by nesting

- 54yo retired research editor, didn't work with Excel that much so didn't

- drawing starts in upper left
  - CODE: upper left
- draws power stations first, then arrows from them, then values

- on explanation uses the term node, making each power station a node and then
  connecting them because power stations are connected (line 2)
  - CODE: nodes for power stations

  - CODE: outlier detection
- participant also noticed power was pretty balanced across stations except
  the last one

- participant said they are unfamiliar with the data but drawing as they did
  here is similar how they do things at work, often making a graph problem.
(They do compilers/debuggers)
  - CODE: often draw problems this way, draw them this way at work

- participant said while they were drawing, they started thinking about how
  they would handle scale of many items like 100 houses
  - CODE: mental model did change
  - CODE: aggregation
- participant at prompting revises the drawing to use directed arrow with

- when asked about gut reaction, says "it's just a categorization of..." and
  asked about seeing what's in their head
- said that this is waht they do all day every day, it's just what their
  network drive or Box would show
  - CODE: Did not look for bigger picture
  - CODE: likened to something form personal life
- said "I was just classifying things as I read them"
  - CODE: Categorization

- They draw a box for each folder and then a numbered list with each contents
  individually
  - CODE: sort-of indented tree
  - CODE: show multiple items individually rather than grouping

- They explain their drawing where the folders are "two buckets" as
  represented by the box. They list the contents underneath and used common
abbreviations for the types based on what made sense to them. They also
numbered them
  - CODE: numbering
  - CODE: file extensions
- When asked about not labeling the folders, they said that it didn't occur to
  them because they're just containers
  - CODE: anonymous containers

- When asked what sticks out, they note there are different fiel types that
  are mixed together, and normally one would group like things together
  - CODE: discomfort with file mixing
- They suggest the files may be related in another way
  - CODE: inferring a scheme must exist
- They say there's not enough information to tell whether it's a meaningful
  grouping
  - CODE: assessing the grouping
  - CODE: missing information / requested information

- When asked how they came up with the diea, they said they work all day in
  file folders like Box and their desktop, so that's how things are organized,
and that was the inspiration
  - CODE: liken to something seen regularly, from personal life

- When asked if their model changed, they said it did not
  - CODE: No mental model change

- They explain they are a project manager so they do a lot of business
  analysis and data analysis and workflows. They also bridge the gap between
technical people who talk in code and business people who don't see things the
same way. They emphasize the importance of communication
  - Note: Not sure how to code this but is interesting

- Facilitator uses above as jumping point to ask how they would communicate
  the data to someone else. They start drawing again: https://osf.io/wdr2y/
- The new drawing has labeled box folders organized vertically with arrows
  pointing to the right, a more traditional indented tree, with the full words
written out for text, image, and code files
  - CODE: indented tree, left-to-right
  - CODE: elaboration on name (or perhaps previous was the abstraction we've
    seen in other datasets
- They explain that htey used more labels/details to better communicate what
  things meant. They also use enclosing rectangles to shown containment
  - CODE: containment / enclosure
  - CODE: details for communication
- They mention showin the hierarchy with the enclosure too
  - CODE: hierarchy

- Facilitator asks more about hierarchy and the switch to left-to-right. They
  said that their first drawing was what they woould see on screen, but when
trying to explain it to someone, they had to recreate the idea of what the
interactions would look like in place. 
  - CODE: They're kind of showing it over time but statically by melding
    differnt states I guess?
- They note they didn't consciously think left-to-right but since people read
  left-to-right, perhaps that's why it seemed natural
  - CODE: make it left-to-right for people

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/ty2k8/ (drawing)

- asked about gut reaction, notes they are all used in an office space
  - CODE: higher level description

- starts by drawing a bucket and then things inside of it
  - CODE: *Not* the order of the items as given
  - CODE: Semi-containment order?

- explains how they drew it as putting everything into the long basket and
  pens/pencils into the pouch
  - CODE: containment
- explains they can carry it all around
  - CODE: practical task
- notes they keep sharpies separate as those don't go in a pencil pouch
  - CODE: personal knowledge

- they say the 4 tacks stick out because you wouldn't carry them around
  - CODE: inferred task (carry them around)
  - CODE: outlier to task detected

- they say they've never worked with a dataset and they came up with this
  encoding randomly
  - CODE: No relation to prior experience in vis
- they do however have these items in real life

- they said their mental model did not change
  - CODE: mental model did not change
- they say if they had done it again, they would make the basket bigger
  - CODE: drawing revisions for space


- 19 you CS major, always visualizes things in mind to understand them

Power Stations

https://osf.io/t45ry/ (notes)
https://osf.io/prtw4/ (drawing)

- what sticks out, they say a lot of different categories
  - CODE: noted categories / data breadth
- when prompted which stikc out the most, they talk about the categories of
  buildings, some with people, some without
  - CODE: building categories

- start drawing in upper left
  - CODE: upper left drawing
- draws axes with a big L and then adds vertical lines to divide the space,
  with labels along the bottom. After having the building type vertical
buckets, writes numeric labels along the y-axis. Then scribbles in some
shading inside the columns, probably to indicate they are bars
  - CODE: bar chart (showing power need? residents?)
- the shading is not tied to an axis
  - CODE: imprecision

- they explain they made "a graph" but are unclear what they were trying to do
  with it
  - CODE: drawing is some kind of chart
  - CODE: doesn't understand encoding
- They say they did plan for the scale
  - CODE: drawing estimation issues
- They say they don't know what to do with the power stations
  - CODE: subset of the data shown (though this appears to be due to not
    having a clear idea of what they were doing)
    - CODE: mental model unclear?
- They suggest they are using the shading to do something with the apartments
  and "each unit" (house?)

- they say what stuck out to them was the differences in each power station
  - Note: that's interesting since they don't show the power stations
- when asked if they considered showing the power stations instead of the
  totals, they say they thought of it and suggest they could have done it like
a pie chart of the power stations
  - CODE: familiar chart suggested
  - CODE: mental model change 
- they note they have only taken high school math
  - CODE: training with data/charts/math

- when asked if they had seen this idea before, they say they have not
  - CODE: Not seen before
- they do however note they do a lot of Excel "but that's like, you just enter
  hte numbers. And you have subcategories"
  - CODE: familiarity with categorization?
- they are asked if they make charts in Excel, they note they only categorize
  - CODE: little vis experience
  - Note: their solution does include categorization however...

- when asked about changing their mental model, they said they did. They said
  reading it, it made sense, but trying to figure out the best way to express
it, they had difficulty doing so concisely with so much goin on
  - CODE: mental model did change
  - CODE: imposed task - express concisely
  - CODE: too complicated?
    - Note: was lack of familiarity with networks an issue here?

- when asked how they might change it, they suggest including the power
  stations
  - Note: this feels like lack of background... it's too bad we couldn't get a
    sense of how it made sense to them. There seems to be a break here between
the mental model and their ability to express it. This feels like it ties into
visual literacy some how and this feels very important
    - CODE: inability to express mental model

- 25 yo nurse, says they somtimes visualize despite the above. Basically in
  terms of tracking things on patients charts. Sometimes a bar is used
  - CODE: so they do have familiarty with bar charts?
- they also talk about what sounds like line charts of weight and BMI
  - CODE: familiarity with line charts
