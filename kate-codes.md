- As the dataset is read, imagines manila folders, similar to "Windows"
  - CODE: similiarity to Windows
  - CODE: relation to icons (and through them "real world objects")
- As the dataset is read, in head organizes first one on the "left"
  - CODE: left-right organization
- As the dataset is read, thinks of things in levels already
  - CODE: hierarchy


- Draws a node-link hierarchy with orthogonal edges
  - CODE: top-bottom node-link hierarchy
  - CODE: orthogonal edges
- Uses different icons for the different types (squiggles for text files,
  photo for pictures)
  - CODE: types as glpyhs/icons
- Root is only added during discussion
  - CODE: rootless at first, root added later
- Talks about things being "connected to but beneath" and needing to "link
  them"
  - CODE: hierarchy described with 'beneath'
  - CODE: word "link" used

- They want to re-organize this data by type ("have all the text files in one
  folder and maybe all the photos in one folder")
  - CODE: desire to organize by type

- They note they got this idea from growing up with computers, using Win98 and
  XP, and thus their file system/structure makes the most sense for them
  - CODE: idea came from something they had seen before
  - CODE: idea came from OS file system

- During hte process, they say that they're imagining the containing folder
  for the first two. They appear to be describing the icon view in the Windows
file system.
  - CODE: revision for the root node
  - NOTE: There is no view in Win98 or XP that looks like what they've drawn!!
- They seem to navigate the hierarchy as it is said
  - CODE: mental model is a subset at a time, not the full set
  - CODE: mental model consistent with drawing, but never full drawing
  - CODE: mental model comes with interactions
- Has high affinity for computers, grew up with them, was a lingist but now an
  IT administrator, and now a CS major
  - CODE: relation to real life


- 28yo CS major, always visualizes data due to their classes, sometimes as a
  hobby (is in computer organization, discrete structures, calc II, and web
development --- no vis!)

- CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the faciliator (circling folders)

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kxze2/ (notes)
https://osf.io/hsy7q/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, tries to "visualize that drawer" and also tries to
  figure out what goes in what container in the drawer.
  - CODE: consider physical image of the drawer
  - CODE: organizing while dataset is read

- They started drawing the big outline (rectangle/drawer) and then added stuff
  from left to write. It sounds like they draw in a hierarchical way...
drawing the drawer, then the containers, then the contents.
  - They ran out of room to put the sharpies in the pouch so then they don't
    put them in there. They note this as they do it. 
    - CODE: run out of room while drawing
- Has a lot of detail in explanation on how the drawer would work (where the
  knobs and edge  would be)
  - CODE: added detail on encompassing drawer
- Is concerned at how neatly things are stacked.
- Makes logical associations between some of the items, like putting the
  stamps with the envelopes.
  - CODE: grouping using containers by logical association
- Notes they drew the pencils unsharpened -- extra state information
  - Note to self: CODE: more "filling in information that's not there"
- They note the junk drawer is actually pretty clean all tings conisdered
  - CODE: situating in reality

- They note the contents seems reasonable for a stationary drawer.
  - CODE: they note the bigger picture that these items do go together
- They note when we said "data set" they expected something more structured,
  like a table or spreadsheet, since that'
  - CODE: Expectation that data is tabular
- They note however that this is a valid dataset because it has objects and
  quantities for those objects (??)
  - CODE: idea of data as having items and attributes (?) or quantities (?)
- They however chose this depiction over a table because they have a similar
  drawer at home and were thinking about it.
  - CODE: matche with real life
- Their mental model maintained constant because they were thinking about
  their own drawer.
  - CODE: Arrangement is highly personal (see also: sock drawer discussion)
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- 20yo CS/MIS major, has not used D3, but has used Power BI and Tableau, though
  not often, just for class... however, likes to visualize in their head while
they read it. 
  - Thinks of stock market increases as a graph (line graph?)
    - Stocks come up in their MIS degree
    - Tries to visualize how much the ups and downs are in terms of scale
  - Also visualizes tree traversals

Power plants

https://osf.io/47sng/ (notes)
https://osf.io/47sng/ (drawing)

- As the dataset is read, they note it sounds like a maths problem
  - In their head, they think of the actual physical power plans and buildings
    - CODE: visualize true phyiscal objects
  - CODE: trying to assign task (math problem)

- While drawing, comes up with icons for building types. Seems like power
  station is a cooling tower with a rectangle. Warehouse they say is a "big,
giant, two or three story building" and raws a rectangular prism. Also draws
houses in 3D.
  - Develop different iconography for different types of buildings
    - CODE: Catagorical icongraphy very popular
    - Note to self: circle back to the idea of data losing its connection to
      reality
- Uses 3D at first but then switches to 2D
  - CODE: abstraction as drawing continues
- Apartment complex based off of one friends live in
  - CODE: Relating directly to personal
    - also notes that power plants based on those back home and in engineering
      students text books, warehouse based on Amazon warehouse.

- Notes they would explain his drawing just like it was written without the
  drawing. Huh.
  - Interesting that they don't explain the drawing, but instead explains teh
    data.
  - CODE: describe dataset, not drawing
  - Seems to be trying to immediately answer some questions about the data "So
    I guess D is proving the most power?"
    - CODE: Naturally seeking tasks
- Notes they don't know what kind of power plants they are
  - CODE: Naturally seeking extra data/information/attributes

- Mental model remained the same but then they "got lazy" with the rendering
  - CODE: mental model did not change
  - They were still imagining the same things but just drawing it more
    abstractly
    - CODE: Uh... abstractions? mental model vs. depictions... depiction
      changes but not mental model


- 21yo CS/Math major, really likes looking at choropleth maps (thought didn't
  know teh term), always tries to visualize first when they hear of data but
doesn't work with data that often.
  - Map interest may stem from childhood, because they had a aworld maps in
    their diaries and stuff

File System


https://osf.io/es7w6/ (notes)
https://osf.io/6n7pa/ (drawing)

(Wow, i thought the drawing was power plants)

- On hearing the dataset: "obviously a folder structure" with nested
  information. Already discusses what they would show in termsof links
  - CODE: nesting
  - CODE: compound node-link daigram?


- Draws each of the first two folders as big rectangles with small "txt" files
  inside, drawing left to right. The imgs the same way.
  - Note that each type is in its own row left to right
    - CODE: Arrangement
- They say they will be lazy and stop labeling the text files iwht "txt" and
  instead just use color to differentiate them. Oh wait, the colors only came
later while they were explaining what they drew.
  - CODE: Abstraction as they continue
  - CODE: Embellishment as they talk to the facilitator
- They make the code files ".java"
  - CODE: Adding extra information
- They draw nested folders at the same level, but use a link from one icon to
  the folder to indicate the relationship.
- They claim this is "pretty standardized for computers"
  - CODE: claim this is how computers do it

- They note they don't know the text file sizes so they drew them all the same
  size to represent that htey're ther.
  - CODE: Requesting extra attributes/info
  - CODE: Icon representations
- They note they color them in because they're pretty
  - CODE: color as aesthetic embellishment
- They use the langauge "reference" to just say they're somewhere even if you
  don't know how big they are.


- They note that they do not know the relationship between teh first and
  second folder. They do not assume they belong in the same folder. This is
different from others. 
- They try to relate the contents to the structure of a program
  - CODE: Relate to something they know
  - CODE: Finding tasks: try to figure out what the dataset "relaly is"


- They note they based their drawing on computers which they have been using
  since childhood and call their drawing "pretty standard"
  - Notes they could separate by type on different operating systems
  - CODE: drawing bsed on what computers are
- They say they've seen something like this before in organizing files for a
  website, but note they could be overassuming
  - CODE: this matches smoething they have seen before
  - CODE: Try to guess the outer context, or something they know, and organize
    that way

- they said their mental model did not change, though they considered adding
  size but figured that owuld be a different dataset
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- When asked to draw with sizes, switches to a stacked bar chart organized by
  file type.
  - CODE: stacked bar chart
  - Drawing reminds them of chocolate bar :)
  - On second promprt, said it reminds them of hard drive fragmentation
    visualization
    - CODE: seen before

- 24yo software developer & CS major w/previous neuroscience degree
  - does visualization w/database queries for reports
  - neuroscience was more bar charts

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/kedv9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kgv76/ (drawing)

- Short due to mic problems

- Have two representation, the first is JSON-like and the second is a weighted
  node-link diagram (second was added in discussion)
  - JSON was key-value with the value being the number of items listed
  - CODE: JSON for unk drawer tallying
- Upon hearing the data description noted it was a lot of office supplies
  - CODE: notice bigger context of all the items

- in interview aftwerwards they confirmed that they related "data" to
  computers
  - CODE: "Data" is something computer-y
- They noted the large number of items
  - CODE: felt it was a lot of items
- They noted they had seen this kind of organization in Python and their CS 2
  course. 
  - CODE: Familiarity from elsewhere with this kind of representation
- They considerd what they call a "web format" which is the node-link diagram
  they then drew.
  - CODE: node-link diagram to show relations
  - CODE: inherent familiaritiy

Power Stations

https://osf.io/qj2pm/ (notes)
https://osf.io/kaemj/ (drawing)

- their drawing is columns of ABC... and rows of house types with a legend on
  the side with the actual numbers.
  - CODE: Arrangement

- WHen read the dataset, said they thought about how much power needed to be
  output
  - CODE: Sets a task/likely problem to solve

- WHen drawing, they first started with a box and then made the rows and
  columns. 
  - Note: Seems like they were trying to come up with a regular organization to
    me


- In explaining it, they note that the size of the box encodes the size of the
  dwelling
  - CODE: Size encoding
- They note the legend/list exists for them to keep track of everything
  - Note: Did they need this / do this because they thought they wouldn't get
    a copy?
  - CODE (Possible depending on earlier question): In-progress
    organization/arrangement before final one, SECOND CODE: Arrangement

- What stuck out: They answer which power station has to be the biggest
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve
- Claims they try to solve the problem because they wanted to assign purpose
  - CODE: Sets a task/problem to solve -- purpose-seeking
- Adds that Power Station F would be the lowest
  - Note: They really went after that task!

- They say they come up with the idea from math problems
  - CODE: Second person to associate this with math/optimizaiton
- They drew boxes because drawing houses would be too much effort
  - CODE: Abstractions, SECOND CODE: Effort

- They bring up some of the scale comparison visualizations like Bezos' wealth
  and the size of astronomical bodies
  - CODE: Size encoding, SECOND CODE: seen something like it before

- 18yo CS major, sometimes visualizes but doesn't like doing it but looks at
  other people's visualizations

File System

https://osf.io/xbw3h/ (notes)
https://osf.io/4aphc/ (drawing)

- drawing is a left-right tidy-esque node link diagram with two source nodes
  (a forest), there is a sub-hierarchy by file type.
  - CODE: file system as tree, SUB-CODE: left-right tree
  - CODE: imposed hierarchy, new hierarchy nodes added for file type
  - CODE: physical icons
  - CODE: icons used in this space before (familiar with Windows)
- There is an added edge at the bottom that the faciliator suggests may be
  about reorganizing the data
  - CODE: Annotation
- There are other annotations about interacting with and uses as well
  - CODE: Annotation
  - CODE: Desire for more data/info

- On having the data set read to them, they associate ith with computers and
  suggest a CS major may have done it. They then explain it/critique it in
terms of organizing a software project.
  - CODE: Assumption this is from a software project
  - CODE: Trying to determine the higher level structure/purpose
  - CODE: (wanting) Arrangement by categorical type 

- Participant notes it's hard to draw exactly what's in their head
  - CODE: Limitation of drawing capability, head != representation
- Participant says they think of the file explorer
  - CODE: file system through file explorer
  - CODE: participant notes drawing cannot be interactive

- Participant is asked about their concerns with organization
  - CODE: arrangement
- Participant says they thought about how they arrange things
  - CODE: arrangement is very personal
  - CODE: relationship to something they know

- 19yo CS major & TA + biochem major
  - notes whether htey visualize data depends on what one considers data
    - CODE: whether something is data or not
  - does some visualization for personal convenience
  - has made some charts in biochem

https://osf.io/bgeh9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dgzrs/ (drawing)

- drawing appears to use color and be done with a digital drawing program.
- drawing represents objects in good facsimile to what they are
  - CODE: physical representations / life-like drawings
- pens are in pencil case, small things are in basket
  - CODE: junk drawer containment imposed
- stamps are near envelopes
  - CODE: organization, arrangment
- colors and details added later
  - CODE: embellishment
- they discuss how / why they chose representations they did, relating back to
  objects they have seen before (e.g., third grade stamps (line 2), what their
parents had (line 4)). Each object has a personal story and memory.
  - CODE: relations to personal, real life

- while dataset being written, participant notes as the items came thought it
  was a home toolbox, but when pens came, thought it was an electricians
toolbox
  - CODE: Trying to see bigger picture behind dataset

- participant discusses ways you can pair the different data (line 19 -
  envelopes/stamps, rubber bands/tacks, pens/pencils/sharpener/pouch) then
says the basket doesn't have a pair which is why it stuck out
  - CODE: arrangement by sets/grouping
  - CODE: outlier as a singleton set

- participant focused on the individual represenation (line 24) in terms of
  which to draw
  - CODE: physical/life-like representations

Power Stations

https://osf.io/gzw56/ (notes)
https://osf.io/dm3ak/ (drawings)

- after having the dataset read, the participant asks whether the emphasis is
  on the data set not the data "containing in it"
  - Note: I wonder what that means, is it thinking of the whole versus the
    parts?
  - CODE (possibly): whole dataset versus data items
- facilitator notes the emphasis is on how they think about the data and
  organize it in their head. participant repeats that the details are not
important, but the organization. Facilitators says its however it makes sense
to them.
- participant does say their initial reaction was what the answer was
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
    - Note: It does seem like while we see this in a lot of places, it is most
      prevalent with the power station dataset and least with the junk drawer
but I would have to double check that after seeing all the data
- participant says they thought about how they might arrange the details in a
  table to get an idea of how much power was required, based on their task
  - CODE: creating a task for the data
  - CODE: table arrangement

- participant draws a node-link diagram showing how power stations connect to
  the different types of buildings and then how the apartment connects to
residents
  - Note: while presumably houses would have residents, the resdients only
    appears connect to the apartment, perhaps because how the data was read
  - CODE: power station, either graph or hierarchy, unclear, left-right
- participant then draws a table with rows for A..F and columns for the types
  of buildings including resdients. The A...F is hte power station column.
They do not add details but say this is how they thought in their mind
  - CODE: power station, table
  - CODE: abstracting away implied details

- participants talks about the types of data they have (e.g., categories) and
  also how specific they are in their connections to types of buildings. Talks
about residents in apartments as a parameter
  - CODE: Casting into a data typology
- participant has hexperience with Python, seaborne, and matplotlib and says
  as such they are used to different types of data and prioritizing some
features, so they were applying that background in data analysis
  - CODE: link to what they know
  - CODE: data organization from/for data analysis tools
- line 15: talks about how much power each type of building needs (the prompt
  was what was powering the most things, but participant converted the rpboem)
  - CODE: wanting other atributes (in this case, power draw)
- line 17: talks about residents and buildings as "end points" that draw power
- line 19 & 23: talks about encpsulating all three different parameters and begins
  drawings/talking through it again. This is the node-link drawing with
operations on the edges at the bottom fo teh sheet
  - CODE: Using drawing to explain to facilitator
  - CODE: expression tree (?) as a node-link diagram, left-right
  - CODE: More suggesting data / format wanted to solve a problem

- when asked what htey noticed, participant said the layered-strcture of the
  data
  - CODE: layers/hierarchy in power station

- when asked what this is like previously, participant talked about chart
  types for algorithm development and also mind map techniques for laying out
connections on paper
  - CODE: related to prior things seen/strategies used

- mental model did not change until problem statement
  - CODE: mental model consistent (need to go back and code the yes/no/maybe
    for this question for everything before!)
  - CODE: introduction of task changed mental model, but it was still quite
    similar

File System

https://osf.io/zn6qj/ (notes)
https://osf.io/y487f/ (drawing)

- when asked initial intuition during reading they said they visualize drawers
  for folders and paper for files
  - CODE: imagine as physical objects


- participant tried to memorize data so the facilitator suggested they write
  it down which they do as a list for each top level folder and an arrow for
the nested one
  - CODE: file system, indented tree
- participant clarifies how a folder can be inside a folder and says they have
  to reimagine that.
- participant says they shift to imagining the icons in Windows
  - CODE: Liken to existing file system iconography
- participant draws with physical nested folders though, in 3D-ish perspective
  - CODE: physical objects
- participant shades text files to differentiate them from other types of
  files
  - CODE: encoding type with color

- when explaining the image, the participant talks about how sheets/files
  would be right next to each other
  - CODE: constraints of physical objects
- facilitator asks why different kinds of markings for the same type and
  participant explains that they could show it at first but then constraints
of occlusion forced them to use labels later
  - CODE: encoding changes forced by space

- participant finds nested folder strange
  - CODE: violation of mental model sticks out

- when asked about the idea, participant refers to windows icons. 
  - Note: I have seen windows icons like this with the folder on the side and
    its showing that there's stuff in there, not sure when those came into
Windows. I assume this doesn't hint that there are folders inside
  - CODE: inspired by OS iconography

- participant says they don't think their mental model changed, but it *did*
  change because they had to fit it all and that caused rearrangement
  - CODE: mental model at a high level did not change
  - CODE: arrangement
- when asked about crossing out adn starting over, participant said they would
  probably keep doing it again and again so they preferred to get the main
thing sketched and once it was good they could always draw a better version
  - CODE: figure out in place

- 21yo CS major, sometimes does visualizations for school... like trees and
  digraphs

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/d4efp/ (notes)
https://osf.io/4reuj/ (drawing)

- On having dataset read, participant notes that items are broken out by
category, that they're office supplies, and the data is discrete
  - CODE: Data typology seen (discrete)
  - CODE: Higher level idea inferred (office supplies)

- Writes labels left to write
  - CODE: Left to right
- Writes in order tha thtings are in the dataset
  - CODE: Dataset list order
- Has to wrap around to fit all labels
  - CODE: Run out of space

- On explaining, suggests they could have grouped some of the items (e.g., the
  baskets) together
  - CODE: Grouping

- When asked what sticks out, notes it felt like the list may have been
  ordered by quantitity
  - CODE: Inferring ordering meaning
- Participant discusses cost of items
  - CODE: Pondering about extra attributes

- Participant notes they work with bar graphs often
  - CODE: Familiarity from life with representation
- Participant notes how they reorganized the names to fit inventory better
  with how they might have been done in the military - nouns first, then
adjectives
  - CODE: Familiarty from real life
  - CODE: identification of nouns and adjectives -- posibbly a typology?
    - Note: How diverse the typologies?

- Participant said that while they were drawing, they thought of a better way
  to organize: by price
  - CODE: arrangement, price order
  - CODE: extra attributes
  - CODE: inferring tasks

- Participant draws second version as the inventory they were speaking of
  (partially to show how they would do it)
  - https://osf.io/u5dge/ (drawing)
- They add X for expendible and D for durable
  - CODE: extra attributes

- Participant talks about how they try to articulate a story such that someone
  else can repeat it in an understandable way and sometimes data gets in the
way of it! (line 31)
  - CODE: story-telling, main point
  - CODE: communication/collaboration
  - CODE: data as a distraction

- 35yo in Sales, uses financial modeling and charts to try to show customer
  value, visualizes often
  - previously platoon leader in engineering company, inventory was a big deal


General Note: This repeated desire for more attributes fights with the desire
to simplify things for the story. I feel like this has something to say about
why data can get wide in attributes but also how much of it people may want to
know at once?

Power Stations

https://osf.io/qmts9/ (notes)
https://osf.io/rqxab/ (drawing)

- Upon being read the dataset, their intuition is that it might be from a
  municipal guide/power company guide. They ask if that's intuition.
  - Note: Is the wording here biasing people to try to see the larger picture?
  - CODE: trying to infer larger picture of data or its source


- Participants notes their discomfort with drawing, notes that they will go
  with how they wrote it as it was being read
  - Note: This may be related to the ordering/arrangement we see
- Participant writes things in a table of power station letters (rows) and
  building types (columns) with numbers at intersections. The intersections
have multipliers for the people in the apartments. Note the column headings
were added by prompting.
  - CODE: Tables for power station
- Partiipant says if the city was noted, they would understand it
  - CODE: desire for more data, source requested

- Participant refers to the drawing as a "graph"
  - CODE: tables are a graph!
- Participant says they put the residential buildings first then the
  commercial/industrial warehouse
  - CODE: arrangement by type
- Participant is asked about how they handled separating the number of
  participants and the number of residents. Participant brings up that homes
can have numbers of people and thus that's necessary
  - CODE: preparing for data not given

- When asked what sticks out, participant notes the power stations do not
  serve many homes and wonders why, could it be renewables?
  - CODE: Smell testing teh data
- Participant verifies they have experience with renewables and was on town's
  energy commission
  - CODE: Relating to waht they know from real life

- Participant said they hadn't seen it before, it just made sense to them
  - CODE: Does not relate to a prior visualization

- Participant said mental model did not really change, even when further
  prompted

- It seems they read the description rather than having it read to them or
  read it before talking about their gut reaction.
- They said they had trouble understanding whether the last sentence referered
  to a new folder on the one previous
- They said they thought of something nested
  - CODE: Nesting
  - Note: I really need to go through and match gut reaction to what they said
    their mental model was and what the drew. I may need to make a table

- Starts in top left
  - CODE: drawing left to right
- Draws an indented tree (see figure), one folder at a time, with inidivudal
  items for the different text and image files
  - CODE: file system similar to indented tree, SUB-CODE: left-right
    indetneded tree
  - Note: People seem to naturally draw the individual items most of the time,
    but not always (see inventory in P17) We should also keep track of this

- On explanation, uses the term "sets"
  - CODE: sets
- They also named the two folders, A and B, to tell them apart, as well as the
  files
  - CODE: assigns IDs
- Second level are assigned numbers along with the type
  - CODE: assigns IDs, develops naming system (possible code name: "develops
    schema")
- They note they have some files wiht the same name, so its really the nesting
  path and the name that is unique. They consider this a potential problem
  - CODE: uniqueness considered
  - CODE: possible edits 


- Participant says they were inspired for this diea by the code they do at
  their job, and coming up with naming systems and access in JSON
  - CODE: related to personal life
- Faciliator asks about curly braces. Participant says they considered it
  - CODE: related to personal life

- Participant said mental model did not change
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- Facilitator discusses the difference between Apple and Windows expectations

- Facilitator asks about not using icons. Participants says they're used to
  variables instead
  - CODE: related to personal life

- Icon conversation prompts a second drawing https://osf.io/q4ybw/ which is
  more like a treemap

  implements looked like (or is this drawing what they looked like) but
otherwise did not change
  - CODE: mental model didn't change
  - CODE: representation needed to change to distinguish categories

- asked how they would communicate it to someone else if that were the task,
  htey said they would probably do it as lists of things that can fit in the
various containers (line 20)
  - CODE: arrangement by size, arrangement by nesting

- 54yo retired research editor, didn't work with Excel that much so didn't
  think of datasets, associated data sets with excel
  - CODE: data = Excel
  - CODE: data analysis = grouping people by demographics
- They said they didn't think of _stuff_ like her as a dataset or organizing
  things as a data task
  - CODE: junk drawer not previously seen as dataset 
    - Note: possible teaching tool?

- gut reaction: says since its mostly residential homes and only one
  warehouse, probably comes from residential part of city
  - CODE: Trying to see larger context / inference
  - CODE: Trying to understand data source

- drawing starts in upper left
  - CODE: upper left
- draws power stations first, then arrows from them, then values
  - CODE: node-link diagram

- on explanation uses the term node, making each power station a node and then
  connecting them because power stations are connected (line 2)
  - CODE: nodes for power stations
  - CODE: connectivity of power stations
- different kinds of buildings have different nodes with annotations for
  size/power
  - CODE: split by category

- participant said the warehouse stuck out because it was the only one in teh
  list
  - CODE: outlier detection
- participant also noticed power was pretty balanced across stations except
  the last one
  - CODE: noticing balance/symmetry

- participant said they are unfamiliar with the data but drawing as they did
  here is similar how they do things at work, often making a graph problem.
(They do compilers/debuggers)
  - CODE: often draw problems this way, draw them this way at work

- participant said while they were drawing, they started thinking about how
  they would handle scale of many items like 100 houses
  - CODE: mental model did change
  - CODE: aggregation
- participant at prompting revises the drawing to use directed arrow with
  labels for the power
  - CODE: directed edges, weighted edges

- 66yo software engineer in compilers, frequently visualizes

https://osf.io/5hsua/ (drawing)

- when asked about gut reaction, says "it's just a categorization of..." and
  asked about seeing what's in their head
- said that this is waht they do all day every day, it's just what their
  network drive or Box would show
  - CODE: Did not look for bigger picture
  - CODE: likened to something form personal life
- said "I was just classifying things as I read them"
  - CODE: Categorization

- They draw a box for each folder and then a numbered list with each contents
  individually
  - CODE: sort-of indented tree
  - CODE: show multiple items individually rather than grouping

- They explain their drawing where the folders are "two buckets" as
  represented by the box. They list the contents underneath and used common
abbreviations for the types based on what made sense to them. They also
numbered them
  - CODE: numbering
  - CODE: file extensions
- When asked about not labeling the folders, they said that it didn't occur to
  them because they're just containers
  - CODE: anonymous containers

- When asked what sticks out, they note there are different fiel types that
  are mixed together, and normally one would group like things together
  - CODE: discomfort with file mixing
- They suggest the files may be related in another way
  - CODE: inferring a scheme must exist
- They say there's not enough information to tell whether it's a meaningful
  grouping
  - CODE: assessing the grouping
  - CODE: missing information / requested information

- When asked how they came up with the diea, they said they work all day in
  file folders like Box and their desktop, so that's how things are organized,
and that was the inspiration
  - CODE: liken to something seen regularly, from personal life

- When asked if their model changed, they said it did not
  - CODE: No mental model change

- They explain they are a project manager so they do a lot of business
  analysis and data analysis and workflows. They also bridge the gap between
technical people who talk in code and business people who don't see things the
same way. They emphasize the importance of communication
  - Note: Not sure how to code this but is interesting

- Facilitator uses above as jumping point to ask how they would communicate
  the data to someone else. They start drawing again: https://osf.io/wdr2y/
- The new drawing has labeled box folders organized vertically with arrows
  pointing to the right, a more traditional indented tree, with the full words
written out for text, image, and code files
  - CODE: indented tree, left-to-right
  - CODE: elaboration on name (or perhaps previous was the abstraction we've
    seen in other datasets
- They explain that htey used more labels/details to better communicate what
  things meant. They also use enclosing rectangles to shown containment
  - CODE: containment / enclosure
  - CODE: details for communication
- They mention showin the hierarchy with the enclosure too
  - CODE: hierarchy

- Facilitator asks more about hierarchy and the switch to left-to-right. They
  said that their first drawing was what they woould see on screen, but when
trying to explain it to someone, they had to recreate the idea of what the
interactions would look like in place. 
  - CODE: They're kind of showing it over time but statically by melding
    differnt states I guess?
- They note they didn't consciously think left-to-right but since people read
  left-to-right, perhaps that's why it seemed natural
  - CODE: make it left-to-right for people

https://osf.io/ty2k8/ (drawing)

- asked about gut reaction, notes they are all used in an office space
  - CODE: higher level description

- starts by drawing a bucket and then things inside of it
  - CODE: *Not* the order of the items as given
  - CODE: Semi-containment order?

- explains how they drew it as putting everything into the long basket and
  pens/pencils into the pouch
  - CODE: containment
- explains they can carry it all around
  - CODE: practical task
- notes they keep sharpies separate as those don't go in a pencil pouch
  - CODE: personal knowledge

- they say the 4 tacks stick out because you wouldn't carry them around
  - CODE: inferred task (carry them around)
  - CODE: outlier to task detected

- they say they've never worked with a dataset and they came up with this
  encoding randomly
  - CODE: No relation to prior experience in vis
- they do however have these items in real life

- they said their mental model did not change
  - CODE: mental model did not change
- they say if they had done it again, they would make the basket bigger
  - CODE: drawing revisions for space

Power Stations

https://osf.io/t45ry/ (notes)
https://osf.io/prtw4/ (drawing)

- what sticks out, they say a lot of different categories
  - CODE: noted categories / data breadth
- when prompted which stikc out the most, they talk about the categories of
  buildings, some with people, some without
  - CODE: building categories

- start drawing in upper left
  - CODE: upper left drawing
- draws axes with a big L and then adds vertical lines to divide the space,
  with labels along the bottom. After having the building type vertical
buckets, writes numeric labels along the y-axis. Then scribbles in some
shading inside the columns, probably to indicate they are bars
  - CODE: bar chart (showing power need? residents?)
- the shading is not tied to an axis
  - CODE: imprecision

- they explain they made "a graph" but are unclear what they were trying to do
  with it
  - CODE: drawing is some kind of chart
  - CODE: doesn't understand encoding
- They say they did plan for the scale
  - CODE: drawing estimation issues
- They say they don't know what to do with the power stations
  - CODE: subset of the data shown (though this appears to be due to not
    having a clear idea of what they were doing)
    - CODE: mental model unclear?
- They suggest they are using the shading to do something with the apartments
  and "each unit" (house?)

- they say what stuck out to them was the differences in each power station
  - Note: that's interesting since they don't show the power stations
- when asked if they considered showing the power stations instead of the
  totals, they say they thought of it and suggest they could have done it like
a pie chart of the power stations
  - CODE: familiar chart suggested
  - CODE: mental model change 
- they note they have only taken high school math
  - CODE: training with data/charts/math

- when asked if they had seen this idea before, they say they have not
  - CODE: Not seen before
- they do however note they do a lot of Excel "but that's like, you just enter
  hte numbers. And you have subcategories"
  - CODE: familiarity with categorization?
- they are asked if they make charts in Excel, they note they only categorize
  - CODE: little vis experience
  - Note: their solution does include categorization however...

- when asked about changing their mental model, they said they did. They said
  reading it, it made sense, but trying to figure out the best way to express
it, they had difficulty doing so concisely with so much goin on
  - CODE: mental model did change
  - CODE: imposed task - express concisely
  - CODE: too complicated?
    - Note: was lack of familiarity with networks an issue here?

- when asked how they might change it, they suggest including the power
  stations
  - Note: this feels like lack of background... it's too bad we couldn't get a
    sense of how it made sense to them. There seems to be a break here between
the mental model and their ability to express it. This feels like it ties into
visual literacy some how and this feels very important
    - CODE: inability to express mental model

- 25 yo nurse, says they somtimes visualize despite the above. Basically in
  terms of tracking things on patients charts. Sometimes a bar is used
  - CODE: so they do have familiarty with bar charts?
- they also talk about what sounds like line charts of weight and BMI
  - CODE: familiarity with line charts

Power Stations

https://osf.io/742fb/ (notes)
https://osf.io/8hsv9/ (drawing)

- their gut reaction was "an image of cell-free MIMO graphs"
  - CODE: immediately associates with image
  - Note: this appears to be some sort of mobile networking concept, based on
    what I remember from taking a class in mobile networking, the 'cell' here
might refer to the areas hexagon'd out by cell towers, but that's not the
absraction in these... they're more amorphous

- while drawing they give each power station letter its own space in 2x3 grid.
  THey put small marks around each letter and then enclose the letter and the
small marks. They appear to use small squares for houses, large rectangle for
the warehouse, and a rectangle with squares inside for the apartment.
  - CODE: sets (my categorization)
  - CODE: enclosure
  - CODE: shapes as categories

- they describe each letter as having a bubble that can include the various
  marks (squares, rectangles). They note the encoding with horizontal
rectangles being warehouses, but vertical ones being apartments
  - CODE: shapes for categories
  - CODE: orientation for categories
  - CODE: encoding made clear

- when asked what sticks out, they noted there was only one warehouse and so
  this was a mostly residential neighborhood (line 5)
  - CODE: unpaired/different object sticks out
  - CODE: unrequested inference "this is a residential neighborhood"

- when asked more about cell-free MIMO graphs, they note they do research in
  ECE (electrical & computer engineering) adn one of their labmates works on this and did a presentation on them. 
  - CODE: had seen something similar before
- they further exlain that when youare in a radius of the cell [sic: tower?]
  then that's what you're connecting to. The power stations are similar --
when you're in their area, you're using that power station
  - CODE: enclosure implies connectivity

- when asked about their mental model, they said it didn't change, but that
  their mental model is more geographical than their drawing. They would have
considered a geographic map with cities and counties rather than "arbitrary
circles"
  - CODE: mental model did not change
  - CODE: did not draw more detailed mental model
  - CODE: geospatial mental model
  - CODE: abstraction used rather than draw details

- they are asked if they would draw the general idea of that mental model, on
  a subset of the data, resulting in: https://osf.io/d8pke/
- They explain it (line 35) with five power stations. The outer rectangle is a
  little township in New Mexico. Squiggly lines divide the land, are maybe
counties or city sections. The same marks are used for the buildings. Power
stations then have their circle radii overlaid, and those overlap some.
  - CODE: geospatial constraints applied to marks 
  - CODE: boundary of land shown as rectangle
- They note they wish they had color to make the circles of the power stations
  more obvious
  - CODE: color as a highlight
- They note in this drawing the circles overlap, "in case of power failures or
  something"
  - CODE: inferring realty constraints

-20o ECE RA and CS major, studies neural networks, visualizes somethings but
less so now that they work with neural networks. When they visaulized more
often, it was data structures in CS.

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/z7w25/ (notes)
https://osf.io/ejqnr/ (drawing)

- to the gut reaction question/intuition, they asked "how I visualize it?"
  - CODE: visualization matched with intuition
    - NOTE: Is there something in our recruitment info that would lead to
      this? Seems interesting otherwise.
- they are told whatever comes to mind and how they visualize is valid. They
  respond that its really random and they expected more similarity between
objects in size and type. They "drew a circle in my head around all of them.
And thatw as it, that was really it"
  - CODE: noted the dissimilarities in type
  - CODE: noted the dissimilarities in size
  - CODE: enclosure of them all together

- upon drawing, they drew the circle as they had said and then starts writing
  the names of the object types on the lined paper. It sounds like it goes
left to right, top to bottom. The object types are followed by their count in
parentheses, only text is used. The final, the long plastic basket, is written
diagonally
  - CODE: use text for items
  - CODE: aggregate by item time
  - CODE: enclosure to show full set

- when explaining it (line 2), they note that they thought of a circle and "in" that
  circle, they have the first time (rubbter bands) and a number in
parentheses. They ask what it could indicate and say it's their number
  - CODE: enclosure of full set
  - CODE: number of items indicated by number
  - CODE: rhetorical quesitoning to explain.
- as they continue they drop the rhetorical but keep explaining where things
  are and what other elements there are
  - CODE: dropped rhetorical
- they note the long plastic basket was "done long" because it's long
  - CODE: length encoding
- they note the pens, pencils and sharpies arent in a group but drawn close
  to each other, perhaps because he unconsciouly grouped them together
  - CODE: grouping by proximity (Gestalt principles)
  - Note: these are written close to each other in the dataset but if they had
    continued as they started, they would have been spread left-to-right, but
they changed their order of writing for them.
- when asked further about the placement, they reiterated that they put them a
  little closer together because "they are close"
  - CODE: grouping by proximity (confirmed)
- they drew the long basket diagonal because they thought it would be
  "hilarious" to write it long
  - CODE: long encodes long, direct encoding
  - CODE: tilt for pop out?

- when asked what sticks out, they also noted the long plastic basket. On
  propmpting, especially in comparison to the small plastic basket, they say because it's long.
  - Note: I wonder if like me, it's because they have trouble knowing exactly
    what it is and in which direction it is long in. We will never know the
mysteries of the long plastic basket.
- They then ask if we meant what's different in the set. THey are told it's
  not what they drew, just in the data. They start saying anything and then
declare there's a pencil pouch that they missed. They also say the baskets
stick because they don't seem to belong.
  - CODE: lack of cohesion with others as reason for sticking out
  - CODE: missed a data point
- They are asked if they put a "(1)" next to single items. They say no
  - CODE: single quantitiy implied

- when asked if they had seen something like this before. They say since 2nd
  grade they have sen Venn diagrams and that they didn't like them in 4th
grade.  (line 26)
  - CODE: had seen something similar before
  - CODE: taught in K-12
  - CODE: set (confirmed)
- facilitator probes on the idea of Venn diagrams having overlapping
  categories, asks why this has one. The participant says it's mood dependent
but they semed like they were all pretty similar, so they didn't look into
detail or "bother" splitting them. However, if they had to, they'd probably
divide the office items out OR perhaps the post office items out.
  - CODE: office grouping
  - CODE: post office grouping
  - CODE: would require more thought so they didn't

- when asked if their mental model change, they said it didn't ecxept when
  they got to the pens, pencils, and shapries they thought of those like a
stack in CS
  - CODE: mental model didn't change overall
  - CODE: mental model became more detailed in process
  - CODE: stacks considered
- when asked how they'd make a stack, they said they would probably draw them
  individually instead of grouped
  - CODE: stack implies individual item

- 19yo CS major, works part-time on a data project working with maps, but just
  started, now visualizes regularly in those last 2-3 weeks of starting see
they visualize there, but has also visualized data sets and structures in
class
  - CODE: familiarity from data structure visualizations

Power stations

https://osf.io/wfrc5/ (notes)
https://osf.io/mpncx/ (drawing)

- when asked about gut reaction, they said they wanted to "make it tidy". They
  said they are not a narrative person and wanted it concise, and thought how
they would change it into an Excel sheet with certain columns
  - CODE: narrative vs. concise
  - CODE: already thinking of reformatting 
  - CODE: tables
  - CODE: Excel
- they said their other reaction was that they don't know about power stations
  and thought they might be confused
  - CODE: domain unfamiliarity and concern

- they started drawing in the upper left and then labeled the columns as they
  described above, though they had to squeeze more for space. Then they drew
the vertical lines to define the columns and a horizontal line under the
labels
  - CODE: table
  - CODE: left to right drawing
  - CODE: inadequate spatial planning
    - Note: need better name, this code seems unduly negative as I suspect
      this happens to us all, we all love our margins and fail to account for
them I wonder.
- they list the A through F beneath the power plant label and start filling in
  table to the table. In the middle of this they add more horizontal lines for
hte rows
  - CODE: gridded table
- data is filled in in written order
  - CODE: written order

- when they describe it, it is a "matrix" "organized by rows and columns"
  where the information corresponding to the row and column is filled in
  - CODE: table = matrix
  - CODE: row and columns language

- when asked what sticks out, they again mention trying to make the narrative
  into something "numeric and linear". They suggest alternative language to
orient them towards types of buildings earlier
  - CODE: narrative form sticks out
  - CODE: suggested language revision to point towards categories
    - Note: they assume this categorization is important

- when asked about how the sentences are not given in alphabetical order and
  if it threw them off, they said that it did.
  - CODE: unexpected order

- asked about Excel, they say they use it every day. 
  - CODE: consistent Excel user
  - CODE: idea came from use of Excel
- when asked what htey use it for, they say they use SAS for visualization and
  not Excel, but they can create simple charts and pivot tables in Excel
  - CODE: Excel used primarily for tables
  - CODE: familiarity with pivot tables
  - CODE: familiarity with charts

- when asked if their mental model changed, they said no, when they tried to
  order it they knew they are doing a matrix and how to create it
  - CODE: mental model did not change
    - Note: it's interesting they use "matrix" and not "sheet" (Excel)
- when prompted about things changing wiht 'warehouse' and 'apartments', they
  said that indeed that hapepned, the columns got added
  - CODE: while mental model as a whole didn't change, it became more
    detailed/revised in place

- 37yo AVP of Assessment & Accreditation at School, describes self as a
  research analyst. They explain they look at institutional data/student
information systems, like retention and graduation of populations. Sometimse
they work with HR data too. Has created table visualizations as part of
job/projects. (line 7)
  - CODE: familiarity with this tabular form
- they note depending on audience they sometimes make infographics and they
  take audience into account that make sense to most people... also they have
to worry about things like a percentage versus "one in five". They also
describe using unit visualizations/isotype charts (line 11). They also note
that if they are presenting to faculty member with "quantiative literacy" they
can use histograms, box plots, or contingency tables.
  - CODE: high visual literacy participant
  - CODE: right data display for the right audience
- they note (line 1) that if they're showing odds ratios, they might leave it
  as a table becasue the group is fine with the table, but other audiences
need pictures
  - CODE: tables for high literacy folks
    - Note: Since this one was form themselves, is that why it was a high
      literacy table?
- they consider themselves as a "sometimes" visualizer at their job, especialy
  now that they're more senior

File System

https://osf.io/q9cn5/ (notes)
https://osf.io/mjen8/ (drawing)

- when asked about their initial reaction, they point out that they got lost
  in the narrative of the "in this folder" and had to backup to think what
that meant
  - Note: this is the second time someone has pointed out that phrase
  - CODE: possible ambiguity sticks out

- they draw from the upper left but ove down from there.  It sounds like
  they're writing text interspered with arrows. The arrows go downn. 
  - CODE: node-link diagram, top - down, othrogonal/straight edges
  - CODE: no root between the two folders
- They group the files within each folder, using "filetype x #"
  - CODE: aggregation of files by type
- They give the folders a name
  - CODE: naming/labeling folders
- At the end they draw a rectangle around the diagram and label it "dataset"
  - CODE: enclosure for the whole dataset


- when describing the dataset, they first use the term "very large data set"
  but then correct themselves
  - Note: Not sure what this means
- when they describe the drawing, they more describe the dataset than the
  pieces of the drawing itself. They don't mention arrows, arrangement, etc
  - CODE: explain dataset rather than drawing
  - Note: though how much have they reorganized it versus what they were
    given?
- when asked why they didn't use icons, they suggest icons can be confusing
  unless its "mutally understood by both people"
  - CODE: icons can confuse people
- they further suggest they might forget what the icons mean if not written
  somewhere.
  - CODE: need to keep track of encoding
- "You can't go wrong with text and it's not long either" (line 6)
  - CODE: text makes things clear
  - CODE: there wasn't too much to write/draw

- when asks what sticks out, at first they are unsure
  - CODE: neesd reflection on what sticks out
- they note that they had initially pictured a dataset for an ML or deep
  learning task when the term "data set" was used and therefore assumed all
the files to be the same type, so they noticed they had different type (line
9)
  - CODE: surprise at what a 'dataset is
     - Note (!!!): I think they think the dataset is what is IN the files, not
       what we have presented to them! I think they never knew what we meant.
       - Several people mentioned the heterogeneous files... were they
         thinking the same thing??
  - CODE: heterogeneous mixing of the files.

- facilitator asks for more information of the dataset in their head. They
  said they would expect folders and subfolders, with the subfolders at the
end having files of the same type. (line 13)
  - CODE: dataset organized with files only at the bottom
- they also said they expected a nested organization of folders with the files
  only at the end OR just one folders with the list of files. (line 13)
  - CODE: dataset organized with files only at the bottom
  - CODE: dataset organized as just a list of files
- they note they don't expect a "date modified" as asked by the facilitator
  unless they know what the data set is for (line 13)
  - CODE: more attributes only if task requires them

- when asked how they came up with this idea, they said that for any
  hierarchy, a tree comes to mind, so that's what they thought of to show.
  - CODE: hierarchy = tree
- they also note they could ahve picked it up in some classes they took
  - CODE: taught representation
- they note they are a computer science major

- when asked if their mental model changed, they said no, especially once they
  figured out the ambiguity regarding the last folder
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- 23 yo CS grad student, GRA, NLP. They visualize data frequently as a go-to
  before further analysis

Junk Drawer

https://osf.io/4u63n/ (notes)
https://osf.io/davzy/ (drawing)

- their gut reaction was that it looks unrelated "seems like a lot of random
  data" but as the list went on, they began to sort into 4 groups
  - CODE: junk drawer seems random
  - CODE: categorization
- on prompting about the groups, they describe "things that help you organized
  tasks", "things for mail", "writing implements", and "holders"
  - CODE: categorization by function!
  - CODE: categorization in order the set is given
    - Note: This is an interesting outcome of ordering

- while drawing they started in the top-middle and divided the page with a
  verticle line. They then write out the first two groups. Then they write the
second two groups under, having divided in quads
  - CODE: divide space evenly in fourths
  - CODE: grouping by task-categorization
- looking at the drawing, each item is listed with a number next to it
  indicating how many except in the "holders" where the number is not listed.
Also the small basket is missing
  - CODE: missing small basket
  - CODE: item type with quantity


- when they explain the data, they call it a "two by two table"
  - CODE: "Table"
- they say the've grouped into four groups each, based on their functionality
  - CODE: "group by functionality
- They re-iterate their rationale from earlier.

- when asked what sticks out, they note it's "just a list of office items with
  numbers on their quantity and they're already sorted.
  - CODE: sees big picture of "office items"
  - CODE: believes they're already sorted

- when asked how they came up with this idea, they said they've never done
  this kind of study before. when further prompted in how they have organized
things previously, they said "probably" but didn't come up with an example
  - CODE: unclear what drawing was based on

- when asked if their mental model change, they said no and they stuck with
  that idea, re-reading only confirmed what they had in mind and the drawign
matches that exactly
  - CODE: mental model did not change

- 19yo CS major who visualizes pretty often in the context of their
  coursework, sounsd like things like state for computer organization as one
example. They also note in their East Asian studies class there's a lot of
terminology so they sort them in concepts with bubbles and arrows connecting
them and annotations
  - Note: sounds like they like to cluster/categorize

Power Station

https://osf.io/bph2d/ (notes)
https://osf.io/u7d5m/ (drawing)

- their gut reaction was that the data is unclear because it doesn't say how
  many people live in the homes, just the apartments and also how the arehouse
fits into the residential stuff. They wouldn't be able to see how many people
are affected
  - CODE: extra attributes/data wanted/missing
  - CODE: declares task ("people affected") and said they couldn't do that
- they suggest it wouldn't be good for certain purposes but isn't necessasrily
  bad. The facilitator asks them what it could be used for or what it needs.
Teh participant explains the estimates of how may people are in each home as a
spread sheet with how many live in each, otherwise you have to estimate by
average
  - CODE: table/Excel requested
  - CODE: suggest average amount per house
- they go on to say the warehouse is less obvious, but may how many people
  worked there and how many hours.
  - CODE: need more about people-hours
- they then suggest that perhaps this is about buildings rather than people,
  but then you'd need amount of apartments
  - CODE: comes up with alternative task matching data better
- they suggest knowing the land-area for the power station would also require
  knowing where houses are
  - CODE: geospatial request

- they draw out a table as a big rectangle, labeling the column headers and
  row labels first. They fill in counts where it exists and put X where it
doesn't. Next to the apartment label they put an asterisk with a annotation
about how many are in each apartment.
  - CODE: table
  - CODE: marks for missing data
  - CODE: handles extra apartment info as a note/annotation

- when asked to describe it, they say "it's mostly a table setup" and epxlain
  "3 variables" as the rows (home, apt, warehouse).
  - CODE: table
- they note the power stations are listed horizontally, briefly calling it at
  x-axis but deciding that doesn't work in a table and saying horizontal again
  - CODE: x-axis has more meaning, does not match with table
- they note their asterisk is next to the apartment signifier and they put it
  down in case it would be useful
  - CODE: signifier
  - CODE: saving all information

- when asks what sticks out, they say the warehouse because there's just one
  of them
  - CODE: the singleton sticks out
- not knowing how many people per home also stuck out to them
  - CODE: missing attribute sticks out
- on prompting, they further explain that since the warehouse isn't
  residential, the power station powering it is not a "residential power
station", so they can think of things in terms of power station C being
different.
  - CODE: the different one, power station C sticks out
- they speak about if you consider how many buildings powered, the data may be
  skewed because the warehouse is just one big building
  - CODE: concerns with summary metrics denominator

- when asked about the idea, they said it's natural for them to put it in a
  table and the easiest for them to understand what's going on. They note they
have worked wiht an lot of Excel spreadhseets in school and even drew things
this way in elementary school due to the logic puzzles they did
  - CODE: table
  - CODE: heavily releated to past experiences in childhood and in school
- facilitator notes the logic puzzles would encourage using X's the way they
  did. They explain the X's make it easier to see/work with. They note in
Excel they would put zero, but those aren't as easy to pick out as being
different
  - CODE: fast readability considered for marks
  - CODE: deliberately set zero values

- when asked about their mental changing, they said it did not. They didn't
  notice things weren't in ABC order the first time but did notice that when
drawing it out
  - CODE: mental model did not change
  - CODE: ordering change did not affect them

- 22yo student changing from chemical engineering to information science. They
  don't think they think of things in terms of pictures in their head that
much, instead they prefer to work with tables and numbers and Excel sheets
  - CODE: does not visualize with images
- facilitator asks if they can recall which power station used the most power.
  They said they would have to look again since they weren't thinking too hard
about it, but the apartment buildings are probably heavy. They make an
estimate for the warehouse and the houses and then say how they would estimate
it based on epople.
  - CODE: does not remember
  - CODE: does come up with an algorithm for calculation
- The faciliator says they asked to see if the person remembered numbers. They
  say instead they just remember C has the warehouse
  - CODE: outlier wins

File System

- They note they were imagining the Windows file explorer until code files
  were present but then they thought of git
  - CODE: like Windows file explorer
  - CODE: like git if there is code files

- Draws manila folder icon with a line down adn then a text list of files.
  - CODE: Icons
  - CODE: top-down tree
  - CODE: individual items
- code files are ".js"
  - CODE: added detail
- nested folder is still a manilla folder, but part of the list

- They explain with the word "icon" that they're using it to represeent a
  folder. 
  - CODE: icons
- They say they use common strings (my word) for identifying text, images, and
  for code they arbitrarily picked a language (javascript) as that's what htey
used (line 2)
  - CODE: personal (javascript)
  - CODE: common well known tags

- WHen asked what sticks out, they note ethat they would not have organized an
  application the way in which this dataset did
  - CODE: concerned with arrangement of file types
  - CODE: what sticks out is what runs counter to their arrangement
- (line 5) "But that's assuming this is more or less exhausitvely
  representative of what's going on"
  - CODE: bigger picture

- When asked about the idea, they note they do programming and have had a lot
  of exposure to the way Windows represents it, so "it's kind of been
programmed into me"
  - CODE: seen it before
- They also describe the interactions to navigate the hierarchy
  - CODE: interactions are part of this mental model

- When asked if their mental model changed, they said it was in trying to
  choose which "tokens" to reprsent the file type. They recognize that they
have picked inconsistent tokens.
  - CODE: tokens/text
- They also note that if they were trying to map this out in a "normal
  relationship", they would do it in terms of tables... sounds like database
tables, but I'm not sure
  - CODE: database tables
- They draw this new type (https://osf.io/s7t2r/). It definitely looks like
  normalized database tables
  - CODE: data is normalized database!
  - CODE: table
- As they explain it, they ealso explain a schema for assigning IDs
  - CODE: ID schema
- When asked what it is, they call it an "entity relationship diagram"
  - CODE: entity relationship diagram
- When asked if they have experience with databases, they confirm
  - CODE: seen it before

- WHen asked about match to mental model, they say its close to the first
  sketch
  - CODE: matches mental model

- 43yo data scientist/programmer who sometimes visualizes things for their job
  in terms of statistica charts

- asked about intuition, they say they thought it was an algebra problem
  because there were quantities to add or subtract
  - CODE: quantities = math
  - CODE: infer task

- they draw a list of pictographs, one for each item, though maybe not all the
  envelopes. When they run out of room in the column, they make a second
column for the baskets
  - CODE: no containment
  - CODE: list
  - CODE: physical representations

- they explain they drew exactly what they saw except for the envelopes they
  drew a box of envelopes that the there were inside
  - CODE: added detail
- they also note they draw the weave on one basket and not the other
  - CODE: details

- when asked what stook out they said the envelopes due to the detail and then
  maybe the long basket and other basket because they had more details
  - CODE: items with longer descriptions stick out

- they say they haven't seen this before and since they're an MS in marketing,
  they are not good at math
  - CODE: have not seen it before
  - CODE: math literacy an issue

- when asked about their mental model, they said it changed a little bit in
  taht they wondered if they needed to add more detail to each thing
  - CODE: mental model changed regarding detail
- when asked detail was artistic or to help clarify, they said it was to
  clarify
  - CODE: detail helps clarify mental model
- they note it's hard to tell the difference between pens, pencils and the
  sharpie the way they drew them, especially for someone else. They also
suggest labeling would help
  - CODE: communication requires more details

- when asked if the drawing matches their mental model, they said "it would be
  good enough for me" but others wouldn't know
  - CODE: does match their mental model though

- 36yo army wife, stay at home parent with MBA in marketing. They say they've
  been told they have a telegraphic memory and it's better for them to write
stuff down and then see it.
