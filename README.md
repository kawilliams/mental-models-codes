# mental-models-codes

This repository serves as documentation of the evolution of codes and categories in a team-based [1] Grounded Theory Method investigation of data mental models. Rules are adapted from Alex Bigelow's [sanitized-wrangling-codes repository](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/sanitized-wrangling-codes).

In the spirit of open science and reproducibility, this repository is publicly visible and will be archived on [osf.io](osf.io), along with the participants' sketches and sanitized notes from interview sessions. As such, please make sure:
  1. No idenifiable information about participants is included in the memo/code/anything you are committing. 
  2. Partially-formed codes are allowed, but in the spirit of active citation [2], please include at least one of the following pieces of evidence with your code commit:
  - for sketch observations, the number of the interview (e.g. Interview 007)
  - for quotes, the number of the interview and the participant's words in quotations
  - a link or paper title when the evidence is coming from a publication
  3. You commit to a separate branch (other than main) and request a review from another author before merging the pull request.


Github's record of our discussions, linked to the evolution of codes, is an important part of our audit trail
so **creating branches and reviewing teammember's merges is paramount.**
